Though the 25-year-old tight end should continue to split time with Mark Andrews going forward, the possible return of Jackson after the team's Week 7 bye should help Likely see an uptick in production.

Starter James Cook still led the backfield with 30 snaps on the night, though he was limited to just one carry in the fourth quarter while the Bills largely abandoned the run and leaned more heavily on Johnson in passing situations. The Bills seemingly view Johnson mainly as a passing-down specialist, and even if Cook were to miss time at some point after the team's Week 7 bye, Davis could still garner a good portion of the carries out of the backfield.",

The third-year wideout out of San Diego State hadn't taken the field for more than one-third of Buffalo's offensive plays in any of the first five weeks and drew a combined five targets over that stretch, but he logged nearly half of the snaps Monday and finished one behind Keon Coleman for the team lead in targets. Despite the modest spike in production, Shavers is likely to see his role get downsized if Buffalo is able to reclaim some health in its pass-catching corps coming out of a Week 7 bye.",

The rookie wideout played 35 of the Broncos' 60 offensive snaps in the contest, tied for the second most wide receiver snaps with Troy Franklin while playing behind Courtland Sutton (48). Bryant's 58 percent snap share was his highest mark of the season, so it's possible the Broncos will look to get him more involved as the season progresses. Nonetheless, the 22-year-old Illinois product remains difficult to trust for fantasy purposes heading into a Week 7 matchup against the Giants.",

The veteran running back was placed on the non-football injury list ahead of training camp after getting hurt during an individual workout in the spring, and the Texans have been non-committal on a timeline for his return ever since. Given that the Texans aren't yet hinting that Mixon will even resume practicing in the near future, the 29-year-old doesn't look like he's on track to be an option in the Houston backfield until late in the season, if at all. The Texans are likely to continue to lean on a timeshare of Nick Chubb and rookie Woody Marks at running back for the foreseeable future.",

Watson served as a backup through the first two weeks, when Christian Kirk was unavailable due to a hamstring injury. When Watson is healthy, he's unlikely to have much of a role.",

With Richardson's injury now set to keep him out for at least four more games, Leonard is the lone healthy option at quarterback on the 53-man roster beyond Jones, though Indianapolis signed veteran Brett Rypien to its practice squad Wednesday. Rypien brings more experience to the table and could eventually make a push for the No. 2 role if he's able to quickly familiarize himself with head coach Shane Steichen's playbook, but Leonard, a rookie sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame, would offer far more fantasy upside if he's forced into action in the event of an injury to Jones. Leonard put his dual-threat abilities on full display during the preseason, carrying seven times for 58 yards while completing 34 of 56 pass attempts (60.7 percent) for 345 yards, one touchdown and one interception over three games.",

The 28-year-old has done an admirable job starting for a thin Chiefs' receiving corps, producing a 30-302-3 line through six weeks of action. The impending doom Brown's managers are currently feeling is the looming return of Kansas City's top WR Rashee Rice. The suspended wideout will return for next Sunday's tilt against the Raiders, potentially eating into his replacement's production in the process. Brown should remain rostered until the dust settles from Rice's return, but expectations should be kept in check for Week 7.",

The speedy wideout has missed two-plus games of action due to injury, but he has now started three consecutive games as his health gradually returns to full strength. Worthy made his first trip to the end zone this season in the primetime win, salvaging what would have been an otherwise disappointing night at the office. The 2024 first-round selection averaged 86.0 combined yards from scrimmage over his first two games back from injury, so Sunday's low usage shouldn't be of concern.

          "long_comment": "Dissly was cleared to return Sunday from a three-game absence due to a knee injury. He ended up playing 26 snaps on offense, which was behind 2025 fifth-rounder Oronde Gadsden (48) and Tucker Fisk (27), but ahead of veteran Tyler Conklin (three). Given the disparity in snap count between Dissly and Gadsden, it appears that the rookie has taken over as the Chargers' No. 1 option at tight end. Up next for the Chargers is a Week 7 home clash against a Colts team whose defense yielded eight catches for 72 yards and a touchdown to tight end Trey McBride in a Week 6 win over the Cardinals.",

Along with Mayer, Tucker looks to be one of the primary beneficiaries from the vacated target volume, and rookie receivers Jack Bech and Dont'e Thornton are also candidates to move into elevated roles. Through the Raiders' first six games, Tucker has produced a 24-356-4 receiving line on 33 targets while adding 29 yards on five carries.

He'd go on to add a four-yard scoring scamper with just under eight minutes left in the contest, a score that narrowed a 26-13 deficit. Achane eclipsed the century mark for the first time this season with Sunday's production, and his carry total was his second highest through the first six contests. The third-year back should play a key role again during a Week 7 road clash against the tough Browns defense.",

Tagovailoa did lead Miami to two fourth-quarter touchdown drives and capped the second one off with a seven-yard scoring toss to Darren Waller with 46 seconds remaining, but he also undeniably played a direct part in the Dolphins falling to 1-5. Tagovailoa's Week 7 matchup is far from ideal in terms of his quest to atone for the turnover-filled performance, as a road trip to Cleveland to face the Browns' aggressive defense awaits.",

According to Jackson, Sanders' original recovery timeline was expected to range from 4-to-5 weeks, but because he's now about six weeks removed from suffering the injury and not yet praccticing, the veteran kicker may have experienced some sort of setback along the way. The Dolphins don't appear eager to rush Sanders back to the field, especially with Riley Patterson having filled in admirably in his stead through the first six weeks of the season.

However, McCarthy practiced Wednesday through Friday only on a limited basis, prompting the Vikings to hold him out for another week while Carson Wentz starts and Max Brosmer serves as his top backup. The Vikings plan to hold off on a decision on a permanent starter at quarterback until McCarthy is 100 percent healthy, and at this stage, the second-year signal-caller may not be a realistic option for the club until Week 9 in Detroit on Nov. 2. Per Adam Schefter of ESPN, McCarthy's ankle sprain was viewed as a six-week injury at the time he got hurt, and with a Thursday night game in Los Angeles versus the Chargers on tap following Sunday's game against Philadelphia, Minnesota doesn't have much incentive to rush the 22-year-old back into action on a short week.",

Addison was on the receiving end of each of Carson Wentz's final three completions and totaled 21 yards on those catches, the last which was a go-ahead 12-yard touchdown grab. For his part, Addison conceded afterward that he wasn't sure if he'd even be able to play in the game, per Seifert, but he made good on his vow to be ready if he did step on the field. Following the completion of his season-opening three-game suspension, Addison has immediately played a key part in Minnesota's air attack with a 9-155-1 line on 14 targets over his first two contests. He'll now prepare to play his first 2025 game stateside following the Week 6 bye when the Vikings host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19 in a contest that could also provide Addison his first regular-season opportunity to work with J.J.

          "long_comment": "Johnson suited up after dealing with an ankle issue during practice for the second week in a row. The 29-year-old also logged exactly two catches for the second straight contest, as he recorded season lows in targets and receiving yards. The lowlight of Johnson's performance came on his second catch when he coughed up a fumble in the fourth quarter. Johnson went from averaging 9.7 targets per game over the first three weeks to averaging 3.0 over the last three weeks. This downturn in opportunities has coincided with the overall decrease in passing attempts for the Saints across the last three games, so it appears his dropoff in production may continue so long as the New Orleans offense eases its reliance on Spencer Rattler's arm. Johnson will look to grab more passes during the Week 7 contest versus Chicago on Sunday, Sept. 19.",

Equally abnormal, the veteran backup's three targets Sunday matched the combined total from his previous five contests. The end result was still unsavory from a fantasy perspective, as Robinson was unable to do much with just five snaps played on offense (seven percent). Fantasy managers shouldn't expect much from Robinson in games that starter Christian McCaffrey is healthy for. The same can be said for next Sunday's tilt against the Falcons.",

Additionally, Bowles labeled Mike Evans (hamstring) as a game-time decision, though the veteran wideout appears likely to play for the first time since Week 3 after practicing Thursday and Saturday. Before deciding on Egbuka's status for the Week 7 contest, Egbuka will go through a pregame workout Monday. If Egbuka moves around well enough in his workout to gain clearance to play, the Buccaneers could still look to limit his snaps to some extent. That being said, even if Egbuka operates with some restrictions Monday, his presence along with the expected return of Evans would be a welcome development for a Tampa Bay offense that has already ruled out two other key playmakers in receiver Chris Godwin (fibula) and running back Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot).",

          "long_comment": "As his collection of numbers indicates, it was a mixed bag of a night for Daniels in his second game back from a knee sprain that cost him a pair of contests. The second-year signal-caller threw a season-high three touchdown passes, connecting with Chris Moore (22 yards), Luke McCaffrey (33 yards) and Zach Ertz (six yards) to erase 13-0 and 16-10 deficits. However, Daniels' first-quarter interception, his first of the season, led to a Bears field goal, and his fumble at Chicago's 45-yard line on an attempted handoff to Jacory Croskey-Merritt with 3:10 remaining and Washington clinging to a two-point lead would eventually result in a game-winning field goal by opposing kicker Jake Moody. Daniels also took three sacks, and this was his first multi-turnover tally of the season. The star quarterback and his teammates don't have time to dwell on the last-second defeat, however, as a road date with the arch-rival Cowboys awaits Sunday afternoon.",

McCaffrey hasn't seen more than three targets in each of the first six games of the regular season. However, he has caught three touchdown passes over his last four games, and the 2024 third-rounder should see more targets from Jayden Daniels against a Dallas secondary that will be without starting cornerback Trevon Diggs (concussion) and could be without starting safety Juanyeh Thomas (migraine).",
