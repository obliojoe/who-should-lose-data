The same can't be said for fellow WRs Marvin Harrison (concussion, limited) and Zay Jones (knee, DNP), who maintained their activity levels into Thursday. Wilson thus is the healthiest among the Cardinals' top three at the position, but there's also the question of who will be under center Week 7, as Kyler Murray remained limited due to a mid-foot sprain. Jacoby Brissett will earn another spot start this weekend if Murray is out.",

Baltimore is on a bye in Week 7, but given that Hopkins has been excellent on a per-target basis (13.7 YPT), it would not be surprising to see his role continue on an upward trend, especially when Lamar Jackson returns.",

With that said, Likely was unable to get much going, as the Ravens' offense continued to struggle without quarterback Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in the lineup. Though the 25-year-old tight end should continue to split time with Mark Andrews going forward, the possible return of Jackson after the team's Week 7 bye should help Likely see an uptick in production. Nonetheless, fantasy managers would be wise to take a wait-and-see approach when Jackson returns before putting Likely into their lineups.

          "long_comment": "Chase's eye-popping reception and target totals were career-high figures, as the All-Pro receiver put together a night for the ages in only his second game working with Joe Flacco. The 2021 first-round pick also struck for his fifth touchdown catch of the season on an eight-yard grab with under five minutes remaining in the first half. Chase's otherworldly numbers aren't completely surprising considering the multiple memorable performances he's already put together in his career, but Thursday's effort was clearly on another level. Given his undeniable chemistry with Flacco, Chase will remain an elite option in all formats during a Week 8 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26.",

The duo combined for 16 completions, 161 yards and a touchdown, and Flacco also connected with Tee Higgins (29 yards) and Noah Fant (five yards) for his other pair of scores. Flacco now has a 5:0 TD:INT through his first pair of games in a Cincinnati uniform, and he'll finally have some extra time to settle in with the playbook ahead of a Week 8 home clash against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26.",

Quinshon Judkins, who scored three rushing touchdowns, and the Browns defense, which picked off Tua Tagovailoa three times and also recorded a pair of sacks, did most of the heavy lifting, leading to Gabriel's lowest passing yardage total yet in three games as a starter. The 2025 third-round pick will face off with Drake Maye and the Patriots on the road in Week 8 next Sunday afternoon.",

The trade deadline is two weeks away, and Sampson could be all alone behind starter Quinshon Judkins if Ford, who is in the final year of his contract, gets moved. That still may not translate into meaningful fantasy value for Sampson with Judkins dominating the backfield workload for Cleveland, but it would put him on the field more often for an offense that typically plays from behind and needs a reliable third-down back.",

Harvey continues to see a modest role in the Broncos' offense, limiting his upside as a rusher. Despite seeing an uptick in his usage as a pass catcher in recent weeks, the 24-year-old's two targets against the Giants were his fewest since Week 2. Barring an injury to Dobbins, Harvey will remain difficult to trust for consistent fantasy production going forward.

Despite the increased involvement, Franklin struggled to connect with quarterback Bo Nix throughout the game, and his touchdown early in the fourth quarter was actually a tipped pass intended for Sutton that Franklin was able secure in the back of the end zone. The Oregon product has been mostly underwhelming as a fantasy option for the past month, but his role as Denver's No. 2 wide receiver has earned him 46 targets through seven games. As long as he continues to stay involved, Franklin should continue to see enough action to make him a viable option for fantasy managers dealing with bye weeks. Next up for the Broncos is a home matchup against the Cowboys and their struggling pass defense.",

The fantasy stud had cooled off over the Lions' last two contests, so managers have to feel elated receiving Monday's late boon to their scores. David Montgomery struggled to generate 39 total yards on 15 touches, but he remains a steady presence as part of Detroit's thunder and lightning backfield. Gibbs sprints into the upcoming bye week tallying 720 combined yards from scrimmage and seven total touchdowns through seven starts in 2025.

The 32-year-old Adams has provided fantasy managers with a 31-431-6 receiving line in what is shaping up to be a renaissance season in 2025. With the Rams entering a bye in Week 8, there is a realistic possibility that Nacua returns from a low-ankle sprain against the Saints in Week 9.

The quarterback proceeded to fumble his first snap of the season, then went three-and-out on the Raiders' next drive before handing off to Dylan Laube on the team's ensuing possession as time expired. Though starter Geno Smith passed for just 67 yards before being pulled from Sunday's contest in the fourth quarter and has thrown an NFL-high 10 interceptions through seven weeks, head coach Pete Carroll didn't hint in his postgame press conference that he was considering a change at quarterback moving forward. As such, Pickett tentatively looks set to remain in a backup role coming out of the Raiders' Week 8 bye.",

The Dolphins don't appear eager to rush Sanders back to the field, especially with Riley Patterson having filled in admirably in his stead through the first six weeks of the season. One of the few bright spots for the 1-5 Dolphins, Patterson has gone 15-for-15 on extra-point attempts and 7-for-8 on field-goal tries, with his lone miss coming from 57 yards out in this past Sunday's 29-27 loss to the Chargers.",

According to Ben Goessling of The Minnesota Star Tribune, O'Connell is leaving the door open for Jones to be activated from IR this week, noting that the work the veteran running back has been able to do off to the side in recent weeks could be enough to compensate for the Vikings' lack of traditional practices leading up to Thursday's contest. Minnesota will have a 21-day window to assess his health, so even if Jones remains out Thursday, he could be added back to the 53-man roster at any point over the next three weeks. Whenever he's reinstated, Jones will likely be deployed in a timeshare out of the backfield with Jordan Mason.",

He'll need to start seeing more scoring opportunities in the red zone to have any reliable fantasy value, which is unlikely considering the inconsistency of the Saints' offense. Hill will look to get back in the end zone during the Week 8 contest against the division-rival Buccaneers.",

In fact, the only Giants wide receiver to catch a pass was Wan'Dale Robinson, who gathered six receptions on 12 targets for 95 yards. In terms of snap count, Hyatt (25 offensive snaps) lagged far behind Robinson (70) and Lil'Jordan Humphrey (74), so it appears Hyatt may drop to No. 4 in the pecking order when Slayton returns to action. On the campaign, Hyatt has managed a meager three catches on nine targets for 17 yards through five games, with all three of his receptions coming in one contest (Week 6 versus Philadelphia).",

The rookie signal-caller finished with his worst completion percentage (45.5) as a pro, but he offset the inefficiency with new highs in passing yards (283) and total touchdowns (four). Dart's fourth and final trip to the end zone came as a rusher, which helped offset a season-low five rush attempts Sunday. The Ole Miss product will attempt to overcome another tough defensive matchup when the Giants visit the Eagles next Sunday. Dart generated 23.6 standard fantasy points when these two teams met in New York back in Week 6.",

Meanwhile, Cam Skattebo continued to lead New York's RBs with 19 touches for 94 yards and a touchdown while out-snapping Tracy 46-28.

Taylor (10-for-22 for 126 yards and two interceptions, 12 yards lost on three sacks) wasn't much more effective in his five drives directing the offense, but the Jets could nonetheless look to the 36-year-old veteran to provide a spark after Fields had been held under 100 passing yards in three of his six starts to date.",

Rodgers connected with Pat Freiermuth for half his scoring tosses -- from 19 and 68 yards out -- and his other two TD strikes went to Freiermuth's position mates Jonnu Smith (10 yards) and Darnell Washington (two yards). Rodgers made several impressive throws throughout the night, including the second touchdown to Freiermuth and his game-ending Hail Mary attempt, corroborating he still has plenty of arm strength and continues to demonstrate his mostly difficult 2024 season with the Jets may have just been a hiccup. Rodgers and his teammates will next turn their attention to a Week 8 home showdown against the Packers on Sunday night, Oct. 26.",

          "long_comment": "Robinson logged 23 snaps on offense (34 percent) as the 49ers' third receiver behind Jauan Jennings and Kendrick Bourne on Sunday. The 30-year-old Robinson was an afterthought on offense in San Francisco's run-heavy gameplan, resulting in zero receptions a week after recording his highest yardage total (44) this season. The fact that the coaching staff prefers Bourne -- who was claimed off of waivers in Week 2 -- over the team's biggest free agent signing this past offseason speaks volumes to how poor of a fit Robinson has been with the 49ers. Fantasy managers would have to be in a desperate situation to rely on Robinson against the Texans in Week 8.",

Mayfield had already been struggling to get the ball to Evans considering the pass on which he suffered the pair of injuries was his fourth target without a catch, and the veteran signal-caller displayed only modest improvement over the rest of the night even though the Lions were playing with an extremely short-handed secondary. Mayfield saw a two-game interception-less streak come to an end as well on a controversial play that originally appeared to be a Cade Otton reception, and it remains to be seen if he'll at least have Chris Godwin (fibula) at his disposal to help offset the loss of Evans in a Week 8 road matchup versus the Saints on Sunday.",

Instead, Pollard earned most of his fantasy value as a pass catcher, with six catches marking his highest total since Week 14 of the 2023 campaign. While it was a positive for Week 7, the likelihood of Pollard repeating this performance in the passing game consistently moving forward is slim. Given the state of the Titans' offense and the split in workload, Pollard has lost much of his fantasy appeal since Spears has returned.",

The 31-year-old Mariota flashed his mobility on a team-high 25-yard scramble, but he didn't do much else after entering the contest in the second half of a blowout loss. Daniels is set to undergo an MRI on his injured hamstring Monday, which should shed more light on the starter's availability for Week 8. If Daniels is unable to go, Mariota would become an enticing stream option against the Chiefs next Monday.",

He caught all four of his targets for 36 yards, with the reception total leading all Washington players. Chosen's opportunity came as a result of Washington's wideout corps being depleted by injuries -- each of Terry McLaurin (quadriceps), Deebo Samuel (heel) and Noah Brown (groin) were unable to play. Chosen's path to further opportunities likely depends on when the team's injured wideouts are able to return.",
