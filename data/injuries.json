With fellow RB Emari Demercado (ankle) inactive, even practice-squad elevation D'Ernest Johnson got in the mix, seeing 14 snaps and taking one carry of no yards. Such a breakdown of work between Knight and Carter will continue for as long as Trey Benson (knee) is sidelined, which is expected to last beyond the Cardinals' Week 8 bye for at least one more game.",

Jacoby Brissett will earn another spot start this weekend if Murray is out.",

While the volume of targets suggests this could have been a bigger game, Pitts has at least five catches in half of his six games this season and has topped 60 receiving yards in two of the last three contests.",

Jackson is expected back in Week 8 following Baltimore's bye, and Rush could be in danger of being demoted to the third-string quarterback.",

Though the 25-year-old tight end should continue to split time with Mark Andrews going forward, the possible return of Jackson after the team's Week 7 bye should help Likely see an uptick in production.

His practice participation Thursday and Friday will likely provide the best indication of whether he can play in the Week 8 matchup against the Panthers.",

Chase's otherworldly numbers aren't completely surprising considering the multiple memorable performances he's already put together in his career, but Thursday's effort was clearly on another level. Given his undeniable chemistry with Flacco, Chase will remain an elite option in all formats during a Week 8 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26.",

Quinshon Judkins, who scored three rushing touchdowns, and the Browns defense, which picked off Tua Tagovailoa three times and also recorded a pair of sacks, did most of the heavy lifting, leading to Gabriel's lowest passing yardage total yet in three games as a starter. The 2025 third-round pick will face off with Drake Maye and the Patriots on the road in Week 8 next Sunday afternoon.",

The game provided more evidence that the rookie is taking over the No. 2 RB role from Ford. The trade deadline is two weeks away, and Sampson could be all alone behind starter Quinshon Judkins if Ford, who is in the final year of his contract, gets moved. That still may not translate into meaningful fantasy value for Sampson with Judkins dominating the backfield workload for Cleveland, but it would put him on the field more often for an offense that typically plays from behind and needs a reliable third-down back.",

The rookie running back played just 20 of the Broncos' 81 offensive snaps, behind both J.K. Dobbins (40) and Tyler Badie (21). Harvey continues to see a modest role in the Broncos' offense, limiting his upside as a rusher. Despite seeing an uptick in his usage as a pass catcher in recent weeks, the 24-year-old's two targets against the Giants were his fewest since Week 2. Barring an injury to Dobbins, Harvey will remain difficult to trust for consistent fantasy production going forward. Up next for Denver is a Week 8 matchup against the Cowboys' vulnerable run defense, which could provide an opportunity for a bounce-back performance for the UCF product.",

The Oregon product has been mostly underwhelming as a fantasy option for the past month, but his role as Denver's No. 2 wide receiver has earned him 46 targets through seven games. As long as he continues to see that kind of volume, Franklin will at least be a viable option for fantasy managers dealing with bye weeks.

He also took over punt-return duties from rookie Jaylin Noel, but that got off to a poor start. Berrios misjudged a punt which he thought would be a touchback, resulting in the Texans' first possession beginning at their own 4-yard line. Berrios could get a chance at redemption in Week 8, as top receiver Nico Collins (concussion) exited Monday's game, which could leave the team short on wideouts against San Francisco.",

The 23-year-old failed to complete 50 percent of his passes while finishing as many touchdown drives as the dominant defense playing behind him. Stroud didn't get much help from his ground game, actually ending Monday's loss as the Texans' leading rusher ahead of Woody Marks (10-15-0) and Nick Chubb (5-16-0). Stroud also lost top wideout Nico Collins early in the fourth quarter to a concussion, a situation worth monitoring ahead of next Sunday's tilt against the 49ers.

Judging from Caserio's comments, Wilson will likely miss more time than the minimum. While responding to questions about the team's injured players, the GM put Watson in a bucket of players whose timeline is less definitive than others. Watson served as a backup through the first two weeks, when Christian Kirk was unavailable due to a hamstring injury. When Watson is healthy, he's unlikely to have much of a role.",

Pittman could be in line to make a splash again in Week 8 against the Titans.",

The 32-year-old Adams has provided fantasy managers with a 31-431-6 receiving line in what is shaping up to be a renaissance season in 2025. With the Rams entering a bye in Week 8, there is a realistic possibility that Nacua returns from a low-ankle sprain against the Saints in Week 9.

Though starter Geno Smith passed for just 67 yards before being pulled from Sunday's contest in the fourth quarter and has thrown an NFL-high 10 interceptions through seven weeks, head coach Pete Carroll didn't hint in his postgame press conference that he was considering a change at quarterback moving forward. As such, Pickett tentatively looks set to remain in a backup role coming out of the Raiders' Week 8 bye.",

Additionally, he's tallied two passes defended, including one interception, and one forced fumble. Spillane is expected to remain a viable IDP option in the Week 8 matchup against the Browns.",

If Rattler can get back to taking care of the football, he should have a longer leash under center. However, he still offers minimal fantasy appeal.",

The 35-year-old was on pace for a career high in receptions last season with 23 through eight games before he tore his ACL in Week 13. Hill's primary usage will still likely come as a rushing quarterback in short-yardage and change-of-pace situations, which was the scenario when he scored a one-yard rushing touchdown on his lone carry during the Week 6 loss to the Patriots. He'll need to start seeing more scoring opportunities in the red zone to have any reliable fantasy value, which is unlikely considering the inconsistency of the Saints' offense. Hill will look to get back in the end zone during the Week 8 contest against the division-rival Buccaneers.",

The rookie signal-caller finished with his worst completion percentage (45.5) as a pro, but he offset the inefficiency with new highs in passing yards (283) and total touchdowns (four). Dart's fourth and final trip to the end zone came as a rusher, which helped offset a season-low five rush attempts Sunday. The Ole Miss product will attempt to overcome another tough defensive matchup when the Giants visit the Eagles next Sunday.

Meanwhile, Cam Skattebo continued to lead New York's RBs with 19 touches for 94 yards and a touchdown while out-snapping Tracy 46-28.

In addition to his 37- and 26-yard scoring strikes to Brown, Hurts also hit the star wideout for a critical 45-yard gain up the left sideline on third down with just under two minutes remaining, a play that would go on to allow Philadelphia to run out the clock.

Freiermuth struck from 19 and 68 yards away in the second half, the latter score coming with just 2:21 remaining and erasing a 30-24 deficit. While Joe Flacco was subsequently able to drive Cincinnati into position for a game-winning field goal, Freiermuth's breakout effort was an especially welcome sight after he'd mustered a 2-17-0 line on four targets over the previous three games. The fifth-year pro will aim to carry over the momentum into a Week 8 Sunday night home battle against the Packers on Oct. 26.",

The fact that the coaching staff prefers Bourne -- who was claimed off of waivers in Week 2 -- over the team's biggest free agent signing this past offseason speaks volumes to how poor of a fit Robinson has been with the 49ers.

Mayfield had already been struggling to get the ball to Evans considering the pass on which he suffered the pair of injuries was his fourth target without a catch, and the veteran signal-caller displayed only modest improvement over the rest of the night even though the Lions were playing with an extremely short-handed secondary. Mayfield saw a two-game interception-less streak come to an end as well on a controversial play that originally appeared to be a Cade Otton reception, and it remains to be seen if he'll at least have Chris Godwin (fibula) at his disposal to help offset the loss of Evans in a Week 8 road matchup versus the Saints on Sunday.",
