With fellow RB Emari Demercado (ankle) inactive, even practice-squad elevation D'Ernest Johnson got in the mix, seeing 14 snaps and taking one carry of no yards. Such a breakdown of work between Knight and Carter will continue for as long as Trey Benson (knee) is sidelined, which is expected to last beyond the Cardinals' Week 8 bye for at least one more game.",

Wilson thus is the healthiest among the Cardinals' top three at the position, but there's also the question of who will be under center Week 7, as Kyler Murray remained limited due to a mid-foot sprain. Jacoby Brissett will earn another spot start this weekend if Murray is out.",

          "long_comment": "Likely's 81 percent offensive snap share was his highest mark of the season. Additionally, his two targets were the most he's seen through three games. With that said, Likely was unable to get much going, as the Ravens' offense continued to struggle without quarterback Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in the lineup. Though the 25-year-old tight end should continue to split time with Mark Andrews going forward, the possible return of Jackson after the team's Week 7 bye should help Likely see an uptick in production. Nonetheless, fantasy managers would be wise to take a wait-and-see approach when Jackson returns before putting Likely into their lineups. Following the bye, the Ravens will host the Bears on Oct. 26.",

McDermott noted that Rapp's injury is still being evaluated, but it's serious enough to hold him out of Wednesday's practice. He's played 342 defensive snaps over the Bills' first six games this season, recording 26 total tackles. Rapp likely needs to upgrade to at least limited practice participation Thursday or Friday to have a chance at playing in Sunday's matchup against the Panthers.",

Chase's otherworldly numbers aren't completely surprising considering the multiple memorable performances he's already put together in his career, but Thursday's effort was clearly on another level. Given his undeniable chemistry with Flacco, Chase will remain an elite option in all formats during a Week 8 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26.",

Harvey continues to see a modest role in the Broncos' offense, limiting his upside as a rusher. Despite seeing an uptick in his usage as a pass catcher in recent weeks, the 24-year-old's two targets against the Giants were his fewest since Week 2. Barring an injury to Dobbins, Harvey will remain difficult to trust for consistent fantasy production going forward.

Despite the increased involvement, Franklin struggled to connect with quarterback Bo Nix, and his touchdown early in the fourth quarter was actually a tipped pass intended for Sutton that Franklin was able secure in the back of the end zone. The Oregon product has been mostly underwhelming as a fantasy option for the past month, but his role as Denver's No. 2 wide receiver has earned him 46 targets through seven games. As long as he continues to see that kind of volume, Franklin will at least be a viable option for fantasy managers dealing with bye weeks. Next up for the Broncos is a home matchup against the Cowboys and their struggling pass defense.",

David Montgomery struggled to generate 39 total yards on 15 touches, but he remains a steady presence as part of Detroit's thunder and lightning backfield. Gibbs sprints into the upcoming bye week tallying 720 combined yards from scrimmage and seven total touchdowns through seven starts in 2025.

It was Cross's first interception of the 2025 regular season and the fifth of his four-year NFL career. The 2022 third-rounder is up to 53 tackles (33 solo), including 1.5 sacks, and three pass defenses through the first seven games of the regular season.",

The 32-year-old Adams has provided fantasy managers with a 31-431-6 receiving line in what is shaping up to be a renaissance season in 2025. With the Rams entering a bye in Week 8, there is a realistic possibility that Nacua returns from a low-ankle sprain against the Saints in Week 9.

The quarterback proceeded to fumble his first snap of the season, then went three-and-out on the Raiders' next drive before handing off to Dylan Laube on the team's ensuing possession as time expired. Though starter Geno Smith passed for just 67 yards before being pulled from Sunday's contest in the fourth quarter and has thrown an NFL-high 10 interceptions through seven weeks, head coach Pete Carroll didn't hint in his postgame press conference that he was considering a change at quarterback moving forward. As such, Pickett tentatively looks set to remain in a backup role coming out of the Raiders' Week 8 bye.",

Hill's primary usage will still likely come as a rushing quarterback in short-yardage and change-of-pace situations, which was the scenario when he scored a one-yard rushing touchdown on his lone carry during the Week 6 loss to the Patriots. He'll need to start seeing more scoring opportunities in the red zone to have any reliable fantasy value, which is unlikely considering the inconsistency of the Saints' offense. Hill will look to get back in the end zone during the Week 8 contest against the division-rival Buccaneers.",

The veteran running back got some extra looks when Tyrone Tracy was sidelined with an injury in Weeks 4 and 5 (and for part of Week 3), but while Tracy and No. 1 RB Cam Skattebo are healthy, it appears Singletary will be relegated to very limited opportunities in the Giants offense.",

Meanwhile, Cam Skattebo continued to lead New York's RBs with 19 touches for 94 yards and a touchdown while out-snapping Tracy 46-28. Sunday's box score suggests that Tracy could have an occasional fantasy impact when the game script favors an increased workload, but it'll be difficult for fantasy managers to deploy him with confidence as long as Skattebo continues to lead the Giants' backfield.",

Hurts was clicking with both of his top receivers, as DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown accounted for 13 of his completions, 304 of his yards and all three of his touchdown passes. In addition to his 37- and 26-yard scoring strikes to Brown, Hurts also hit the star wideout for a critical 45-yard gain up the left sideline on third down with just under two minutes remaining, a play that would go on to allow Philadelphia to run out the clock.

Rodgers connected with Pat Freiermuth for half his scoring tosses -- from 19 and 68 yards out -- and his other two TD strikes went to Freiermuth's position mates Jonnu Smith (10 yards) and Darnell Washington (two yards). Rodgers made several impressive throws throughout the night, including the second touchdown to Freiermuth and his game-ending Hail Mary attempt, corroborating he still has plenty of arm strength and continues to demonstrate his mostly difficult 2024 season with the Jets may have just been a hiccup. Rodgers and his teammates will next turn their attention to a Week 8 home showdown against the Packers on Sunday night, Oct. 26.",

Walker still is providing more volume out of Seattle's backfield through seven weeks, generating 430 rushing yards off of a career-best 4.7 YPC with three trips to the end zone himself.

The 30-year-old Robinson was an afterthought on offense in San Francisco's run-heavy gameplan, resulting in zero receptions a week after recording his highest yardage total (44) this season. The fact that the coaching staff prefers Bourne -- who was claimed off of waivers in Week 2 -- over the team's biggest free agent signing this past offseason speaks volumes to how poor of a fit Robinson has been with the 49ers. Fantasy managers would have to be in a desperate situation to rely on Robinson against the Texans in Week 8.",

For now, he's officially ruled out for the next four games on injured reserve, with surgery scheduled this week.",

He had scored in three of four contests leading up to the Week 7 loss, but versus the Cowboys all of rookie fourth-rounder Jaylin Lane, veteran receivers Chris Moore and Robbie Chosen and tight end Zach Ertz finished with more targets and yardage than McCaffrey, That will make him difficult to trust for fantasy purposes heading into a tough primetime matchup against the Chiefs on Monday, Oct. 27 in Week 8, especially if Daniels is unable to go and Marcus Mariota draws the start at QB.",

Chosen's opportunity came as a result of Washington's wideout corps being depleted by injuries -- each of Terry McLaurin (quadriceps), Deebo Samuel (heel) and Noah Brown (groin) were unable to play.
