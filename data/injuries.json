With fellow RB Emari Demercado (ankle) inactive, even practice-squad elevation D'Ernest Johnson got in the mix, seeing 14 snaps and taking one carry of no yards. Such a breakdown of work between Knight and Carter will continue for as long as Trey Benson (knee) is sidelined, which is expected to last beyond the Cardinals' Week 8 bye for at least one more game.",

Wilson thus is the healthiest among the Cardinals' top three at the position, but there's also the question of who will be under center Week 7, as Kyler Murray remained limited due to a mid-foot sprain. Jacoby Brissett will earn another spot start this weekend if Murray is out.",

Chase's otherworldly numbers aren't completely surprising considering the multiple memorable performances he's already put together in his career, but Thursday's effort was clearly on another level. Given his undeniable chemistry with Flacco, Chase will remain an elite option in all formats during a Week 8 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26.",

The duo combined for 16 completions, 161 yards and a touchdown, and Flacco also connected with Tee Higgins (29 yards) and Noah Fant (five yards) for his other pair of scores. Flacco now has a 5:0 TD:INT through his first pair of games in a Cincinnati uniform, and he'll finally have some extra time to settle in with the playbook ahead of a Week 8 home clash against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26.",

The rookie running back played just 20 of the Broncos' 81 offensive snaps, behind both J.K. Dobbins (40) and Tyler Badie (21). Harvey continues to see a modest role in the Broncos' offense, limiting his upside as a rusher. Despite seeing an uptick in his usage as a pass catcher in recent weeks, the 24-year-old's two targets against the Giants were his fewest since Week 2. Barring an injury to Dobbins, Harvey will remain difficult to trust for consistent fantasy production going forward. Up next for Denver is a Week 8 matchup against the Cowboys' vulnerable run defense, which could provide an opportunity for a bounce-back performance for the UCF product.",

The Oregon product has been mostly underwhelming as a fantasy option for the past month, but his role as Denver's No. 2 wide receiver has earned him 46 targets through seven games. As long as he continues to see that kind of volume, Franklin will at least be a viable option for fantasy managers dealing with bye weeks. Next up for the Broncos is a home matchup against the Cowboys and their struggling pass defense.",

He also added a three-yard scoring run early in the second quarter for his first NFL touchdown, rounding out his night nicely.

The 32-year-old Adams has provided fantasy managers with a 31-431-6 receiving line in what is shaping up to be a renaissance season in 2025. With the Rams entering a bye in Week 8, there is a realistic possibility that Nacua returns from a low-ankle sprain against the Saints in Week 9.

For now, the Rams are content in using all four of their tight ends in rotation, which caps the upside of the talented rookie at the moment.

Though starter Geno Smith passed for just 67 yards before being pulled from Sunday's contest in the fourth quarter and has thrown an NFL-high 10 interceptions through seven weeks, head coach Pete Carroll didn't hint in his postgame press conference that he was considering a change at quarterback moving forward.

Rattler tossed three interceptions and lost one fumble against Chicago, but prior to Week 7 he'd only thrown one pick and lost zero fumbles. If Rattler can get back to taking care of the football, he should have a longer leash under center. However, he still offers minimal fantasy appeal.",

The 35-year-old was on pace for a career high in receptions last season with 23 through eight games before he tore his ACL in Week 13. Hill's primary usage will still likely come as a rushing quarterback in short-yardage and change-of-pace situations, which was the scenario when he scored a one-yard rushing touchdown on his lone carry during the Week 6 loss to the Patriots. He'll need to start seeing more scoring opportunities in the red zone to have any reliable fantasy value, which is unlikely considering the inconsistency of the Saints' offense. Hill will look to get back in the end zone during the Week 8 contest against the division-rival Buccaneers.",

His two carries came on back-to-back plays late in the second period, and he logged just one additional offensive snap in the contest. The veteran running back got some extra looks when Tyrone Tracy was sidelined with an injury in Weeks 4 and 5 (and for part of Week 3), but while Tracy and No. 1 RB Cam Skattebo are healthy, it appears Singletary will be relegated to very limited opportunities in the Giants offense.",

In terms of snap count, Hyatt (25 offensive snaps) lagged far behind Robinson (70) and Lil'Jordan Humphrey (74), so it appears Hyatt may drop to No. 4 in the pecking order when Slayton returns to action. On the campaign, Hyatt has managed a meager three catches on nine targets for 17 yards through five games, with all three of his receptions coming in one contest (Week 6 versus Philadelphia).",

The fact that the coaching staff prefers Bourne -- who was claimed off of waivers in Week 2 -- over the team's biggest free agent signing this past offseason speaks volumes to how poor of a fit Robinson has been with the 49ers.

It sounds, at least, as though the team is confident Evans will be able to contribute in the postseason if Tampa Bay earns a playoff berth. In the meantime, Chris Godwin (fibula) has been ruled out for Sunday's matchup against the Saints, but he could be a candidate to return to action after the Buccaneers' bye in Week 9.",

          "long_comment": "McCaffrey wasn't able to take advantage of absences of Terry McLaurin (quadriceps), Noah Brown (groin/knee, IR) and Deebo Samuel (heel) versus Dallas, though the departure of quarterback Jayden Daniels (hamstring) early in the second half didn't help matters. He had scored in three of four contests leading up to the Week 7 loss, but versus the Cowboys all of rookie fourth-rounder Jaylin Lane, veteran receivers Chris Moore and Robbie Chosen and tight end Zach Ertz finished with more targets and yardage than McCaffrey, That will make him difficult to trust for fantasy purposes heading into a tough primetime matchup against the Chiefs on Monday, Oct. 27 in Week 8, especially if Daniels is unable to go and Marcus Mariota draws the start at QB.",

Chosen's opportunity came as a result of Washington's wideout corps being depleted by injuries -- each of Terry McLaurin (quadriceps), Deebo Samuel (heel) and Noah Brown (groin) were unable to play.
