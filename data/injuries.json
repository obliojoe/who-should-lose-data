Though the 25-year-old tight end should continue to split time with Mark Andrews going forward, the possible return of Jackson after the team's Week 7 bye should help Likely see an uptick in production. Nonetheless, fantasy managers would be wise to take a wait-and-see approach when Jackson returns before putting Likely into their lineups.

The Bills are on a bye for Week 7, so it's possible that the fourth-year linebacker is available for the Bills' Week 8 road clash against the Panthers on Sunday, Oct. 26. With Shaq Thompson filling in for the injured Matt Milano (pectoral), Joe Andreessen would be a candidate to see more snaps on defense if Bernard were to be sidelined.",

          "long_comment": "With two pass catchers in Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) and Dalton Kincaid (oblique) inactive for the Week 6 contest and with another in Joshua Palmer (ankle) exiting the contest early, Shavers benefited from an expanded profile in the Buffalo offense. The third-year wideout out of San Diego State hadn't taken the field for more than one-third of Buffalo's offensive plays in any of the first five weeks and drew a combined five targets over that stretch, but he logged nearly half of the snaps Monday and finished one behind Keon Coleman for the team lead in targets. Despite the modest spike in production, Shavers is likely to see his role get downsized if Buffalo is able to reclaim some health in its pass-catching corps coming out of a Week 7 bye.",

While responding to questions about the team's injured players, the GM put Watson in a bucket of players whose timeline is less definitive than others. Watson served as a backup through the first two weeks, when Christian Kirk was unavailable due to a hamstring injury. When Watson is healthy, he's unlikely to have much of a role.",

With Richardson's injury now set to keep him out for at least four more games, Leonard is the lone healthy option at quarterback on the 53-man roster beyond Jones, though Indianapolis signed veteran Brett Rypien to its practice squad Wednesday. Rypien brings more experience to the table and could eventually make a push for the No. 2 role if he's able to quickly familiarize himself with head coach Shane Steichen's playbook, but Leonard, a rookie sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame, would offer far more fantasy upside if he's forced into action in the event of an injury to Jones. Leonard put his dual-threat abilities on full display during the preseason, carrying seven times for 58 yards while completing 34 of 56 pass attempts (60.7 percent) for 345 yards, one touchdown and one interception over three games.",

Rice also dealt with a groin injury during the preseason, but there's been no hint of any trouble there since August.

The speedy wideout has missed two-plus games of action due to injury, but he has now started three consecutive games as his health gradually returns to full strength. Worthy made his first trip to the end zone this season in the primetime win, salvaging what would have been an otherwise disappointing night at the office. The 2024 first-round selection averaged 86.0 combined yards from scrimmage over his first two games back from injury, so Sunday's low usage shouldn't be of concern. The biggest threat to Worthy's target share in Week 7 is the scheduled return of suspended WR Rashee Rice, who is likely to reclaim his role as Kansas City's top wideout against Las Vegas next Sunday.",

Garafolo notes that Hassan Haskins is likely to serve as the Chargers' lead back Sunday in Miami while practice-squad signee Kimani Vidal also sees work, but Los Angeles is also expected to be in the market for a running back ahead of the Nov. 4 trade deadline to compensate for the long-term injuries to Hampton and Najee Harris (Achilles).",

The 2020 first-round pick's first two INTs were much more ill-timed, as Tagovailoa short-circuited drives at the Chargers' 39-yard line and his own 37, which led to 10 points for Los Angeles. Tagovailoa did lead Miami to two fourth-quarter touchdown drives and capped the second one off with a seven-yard scoring toss to Darren Waller with 46 seconds remaining, but he also undeniably played a direct part in the Dolphins falling to 1-5. Tagovailoa's Week 7 matchup is far from ideal in terms of his quest to atone for the turnover-filled performance, as a road trip to Cleveland to face the Browns' aggressive defense awaits.",

Akers has already been elevated to Minnesota's active roster three times, which is the maximum allowed for a season. He would have to be signed to the active roster in order to play for the Vikings for the rest of the season.",

Per Alec Lewis of The Athletic, O'Connell also wouldn't name a starter for Week 7 between Wentz and second-year pro J.J. McCarthy, who was limited Wednesday in his first practice since he suffered a high right-ankle sprain Week 2. How McCarthy fares as the week continues likely will determine who is under center for Minnesota on Sunday versus the Eagles.",

Addison was efficient with his opportunities, and the bulk of those came at the tail end of the Vikings' game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. Addison was on the receiving end of each of Carson Wentz's final three completions and totaled 21 yards on those catches, the last which was a go-ahead 12-yard touchdown grab. For his part, Addison conceded afterward that he wasn't sure if he'd even be able to play in the game, per Seifert, but he made good on his vow to be ready if he did step on the field. Following the completion of his season-opening three-game suspension, Addison has immediately played a key part in Minnesota's air attack with a 9-155-1 line on 14 targets over his first two contests. He'll now prepare to play his first 2025 game stateside following the Week 6 bye when the Vikings host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19 in a contest that could also provide Addison his first regular-season opportunity to work with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) as his quarterback.",

Johnson went from averaging 9.7 targets per game over the first three weeks to averaging 3.0 over the last three weeks. This downturn in opportunities has coincided with the overall decrease in passing attempts for the Saints across the last three games, so it appears his dropoff in production may continue so long as the New Orleans offense eases its reliance on Spencer Rattler's arm.

Shaheed may have a better chance of making an impact in Week 7 against the Bears.",

Jalin Hyatt (29 offensive snaps) was also above Collins in the pecking order, and the latter's participation level was his lowest since he played exclusively on special teams in Week 2 versus Dallas.

That led to an expectation that he would be significantly involved on offense in Week 6 with New York depleted at the wideout position, per Jordan Raanan of ESPN.com, but things didn't shake out that way. While Bellinger did log a healthy 57 percent snap share, he never had a pass thrown his way during a game in which New York leaned heavily on its ground game. Meanwhile, No. 1 tight end Theo Johnson caught two of four targets for 27 yards and logged a 90 percent snap share. Though Bellinger has caught every one of his targets so far this season, that's resulted in a very modest 7-85-0 receiving line through six contests.",

Hurts exceeded 30 pass attempts for a second consecutive contest for the first time this season, and he averaged a season-best 8.6 yards per attempt Thursday while connecting with six different targets. The sixth-year pro's one interception also was very costly, however, as it came at the Giants' nine-yard line early in the fourth quarter with the Eagles down 10 and was returned all the way to Philadelphia's 23-yard line to set up the New York's game-clinching touchdown.

Rodgers made several impressive throws throughout the night, including the second touchdown to Freiermuth and his game-ending Hail Mary attempt, corroborating he still has plenty of arm strength and continues to demonstrate his mostly difficult 2024 season with the Jets may have just been a hiccup.
