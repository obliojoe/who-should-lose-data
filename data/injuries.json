The same can't be said for fellow WRs Marvin Harrison (concussion, limited) and Zay Jones (knee, DNP), who maintained their activity levels into Thursday. Wilson thus is the healthiest among the Cardinals' top three at the position, but there's also the question of who will be under center Week 7, as Kyler Murray remained limited due to a mid-foot sprain. Jacoby Brissett will earn another spot start this weekend if Murray is out.",

With that said, Likely was unable to get much going, as the Ravens' offense continued to struggle without quarterback Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in the lineup. Though the 25-year-old tight end should continue to split time with Mark Andrews going forward, the possible return of Jackson after the team's Week 7 bye should help Likely see an uptick in production. Nonetheless, fantasy managers would be wise to take a wait-and-see approach when Jackson returns before putting Likely into their lineups.

The Bills are on a bye for Week 7, so it's possible that the fourth-year linebacker is available for the Bills' Week 8 road clash against the Panthers on Sunday, Oct. 26. With Shaq Thompson filling in for the injured Matt Milano (pectoral), Joe Andreessen would be a candidate to see more snaps on defense if Bernard were to be sidelined.",

          "long_comment": "With two pass catchers in Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) and Dalton Kincaid (oblique) inactive for the Week 6 contest and with another in Joshua Palmer (ankle) exiting the contest early, Shavers benefited from an expanded profile in the Buffalo offense. The third-year wideout out of San Diego State hadn't taken the field for more than one-third of Buffalo's offensive plays in any of the first five weeks and drew a combined five targets over that stretch, but he logged nearly half of the snaps Monday and finished one behind Keon Coleman for the team lead in targets. Despite the modest spike in production, Shavers is likely to see his role get downsized if Buffalo is able to reclaim some health in its pass-catching corps coming out of a Week 7 bye.",

The rookie wideout played 35 of the Broncos' 60 offensive snaps in the contest, tied for the second most wide receiver snaps with Troy Franklin while playing behind Courtland Sutton (48). Bryant's 58 percent snap share was his highest mark of the season, so it's possible the Broncos will look to get him more involved as the season progresses. Nonetheless, the 22-year-old Illinois product remains difficult to trust for fantasy purposes heading into a Week 7 matchup against the Giants.",

The silver lining for fantasy managers was that the wideout remained involved offensively following the turnover, receiving three more touches in the narrow win. Franklin has shown flashes of upside early in his sophomore campaign, but Sunday's dud is an example of the inconsistency he can exhibit. The 22-year-old's value is likely limited to deeper formats in next Sunday's tilt against the Giants.",

Injuries have paved the way for the 2024 second-round draft pick to reclaim a role in three-receiver sets alongside Michael Pittman and Alec Pierce, but Mitchell will face a Chargers defense that has allowed only two touchdowns to wide receivers this season.",

          "short_comment": "Leonard appears in line to serve as the top backup to starting quarterback Daniel Jones for a second straight game Sunday against the Chargers after the Colts placed Anthony Richardson (orbital) on injured reserve Monday, Stephen Holder of ESPN.com reports.",
          "long_comment": "After being inactive for the first five games of the season, Leonard suited up as the Colts' No. 2 quarterback during this past Sunday's 31-27 win over the Cardinals due to Richardson sustaining an orbital fracture in a freak pregame accident. With Richardson's injury now set to keep him out for at least four more games, Leonard is the lone healthy option at quarterback on the 53-man roster beyond Jones, though Indianapolis signed veteran Brett Rypien to its practice squad Wednesday. Rypien brings more experience to the table and could eventually make a push for the No. 2 role if he's able to quickly familiarize himself with head coach Shane Steichen's playbook, but Leonard, a rookie sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame, would offer far more fantasy upside if he's forced into action in the event of an injury to Jones. Leonard put his dual-threat abilities on full display during the preseason, carrying seven times for 58 yards while completing 34 of 56 pass attempts (60.7 percent) for 345 yards, one touchdown and one interception over three games.",

The impending doom Brown's managers are currently feeling is the looming return of Kansas City's top WR Rashee Rice. The suspended wideout will return for next Sunday's tilt against the Raiders, potentially eating into his replacement's production in the process. Brown should remain rostered until the dust settles from Rice's return, but expectations should be kept in check for Week 7.",

The 32-year-old Adams has provided fantasy managers with a 31-431-6 receiving line in what is shaping up to be a renaissance season in 2025. With the Rams entering a bye in Week 8, there is a realistic possibility that Nacua returns from a low-ankle sprain against the Saints in Week 9.

Along with Mayer, Tucker looks to be one of the primary beneficiaries from the vacated target volume, and rookie receivers Jack Bech and Dont'e Thornton are also candidates to move into elevated roles. Through the Raiders' first six games, Tucker has produced a 24-356-4 receiving line on 33 targets while adding 29 yards on five carries. According to McFadden, quarterbacks have a 134.6 passer rating when targeting Tucker, good for the fifth-highest mark among all wideouts in the NFL.",

The subsequent pair of picks came on back-to-back possessions in the fourth quarter, and head coach Mike McDaniel opted to bench the 2020 first-round pick after the second miscue. Tagovailoa came into the afternoon fresh off another three-interception tally at home versus the Chargers in Week 6, and it may be fair to question his hold on the starting job heading into a thorny Week 8 road matchup against a talented Falcons defense.",

According to Jackson, Sanders' original recovery timeline was expected to range from 4-to-5 weeks, but because he's now about six weeks removed from suffering the injury and not yet praccticing, the veteran kicker may have experienced some sort of setback along the way. The Dolphins don't appear eager to rush Sanders back to the field, especially with Riley Patterson having filled in admirably in his stead through the first six weeks of the season. One of the few bright spots for the 1-5 Dolphins, Patterson has gone 15-for-15 on extra-point attempts and 7-for-8 on field-goal tries, with his lone miss coming from 57 yards out in this past Sunday's 29-27 loss to the Chargers.",

The Vikings plan to hold off on a decision on a permanent starter at quarterback until McCarthy is 100 percent healthy, and at this stage, the second-year signal-caller may not be a realistic option for the club until Week 9 in Detroit on Nov. 2. Per Adam Schefter of ESPN, McCarthy's ankle sprain was viewed as a six-week injury at the time he got hurt, and with a Thursday night game in Los Angeles versus the Chargers on tap following Sunday's game against Philadelphia, Minnesota doesn't have much incentive to rush the 22-year-old back into action on a short week.",

Hockenson reversed on replay when it was determined the tight end didn't maintain control all the way through his attempted catch. Wentz's yardage total marked his second time eclipsing the 300-yard threshold during his four-game starting tenure, and he projects to remain under center for Thursday night's Week 8 road matchup against the Chargers since the Vikings are expected to give J.J.

The 35-year-old was on pace for a career high in receptions last season with 23 through eight games before he tore his ACL in Week 13. Hill's primary usage will still likely come as a rushing quarterback in short-yardage and change-of-pace situations, which was the scenario when he scored a one-yard rushing touchdown on his lone carry during the Week 6 loss to the Patriots. He'll need to start seeing more scoring opportunities in the red zone to have any reliable fantasy value, which is unlikely considering the inconsistency of the Saints' offense. Hill will look to get back in the end zone during the Week 8 contest against the division-rival Buccaneers.",

The rookie signal-caller finished with his worst completion percentage (45.5) as a pro, but he offset the inefficiency with new highs in passing yards (283) and total touchdowns (four). Dart's fourth and final trip to the end zone came as a rusher, which helped offset a season-low five rush attempts Sunday. The Ole Miss product will attempt to overcome another tough defensive matchup when the Giants visit the Eagles next Sunday.

The first two of those receptions went for touchdowns in the first and fourth quarter, respectively, while the final one came on third down with less than two minutes remaining and allowed the Eagles to run out the clock. Brown has between six and 10 targets over his last six games, and he's come alive in the last pair of contests with a 10-201-2 line in that span. Brown and the Eagles will be looking for a bit of revenge Week 8, as a Giants team they just lost to in Week 6 pays a visit to Philadelphia next Sunday afternoon.",

Hurts was clicking with both of his top receivers, as DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown accounted for 13 of his completions, 304 of his yards and all three of his touchdown passes. In addition to his 37- and 26-yard scoring strikes to Brown, Hurts also hit the star wideout for a critical 45-yard gain up the left sideline on third down with just under two minutes remaining, a play that would go on to allow Philadelphia to run out the clock.

Rodgers made several impressive throws throughout the night, including the second touchdown to Freiermuth and his game-ending Hail Mary attempt, corroborating he still has plenty of arm strength and continues to demonstrate his mostly difficult 2024 season with the Jets may have just been a hiccup. Rodgers and his teammates will next turn their attention to a Week 8 home showdown against the Packers on Sunday night, Oct. 26.",

          "long_comment": "Walker logged two fewer carries than Zach Charbonnet, but he outgained his teammate by 10 rushing yards, as neither back was particularly efficient during the defense-centric battle. The fourth-year pro's yardage total represented quite the downturn after he'd topped the 80-yard mark in each of the previous two games, and Charbonnet's workload is somewhat of a concern for the moment for Walker's fantasy managers. It remains to be seen if a similar timeshare will apply moving forward, but neither player has a particularly bright outlook for a Week 7 home matchup against a tough Texans defense on Monday night, Oct. 20.",

Additionally, Bowles labeled Mike Evans (hamstring) as a game-time decision, though the veteran wideout appears likely to play for the first time since Week 3 after practicing Thursday and Saturday. Before deciding on Egbuka's status for the Week 7 contest, Egbuka will go through a pregame workout Monday. If Egbuka moves around well enough in his workout to gain clearance to play, the Buccaneers could still look to limit his snaps to some extent. That being said, even if Egbuka operates with some restrictions Monday, his presence along with the expected return of Evans would be a welcome development for a Tampa Bay offense that has already ruled out two other key playmakers in receiver Chris Godwin (fibula) and running back Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot).",
