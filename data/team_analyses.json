Their inability to convert third downs (28th in the league) means they'll struggle to sustain drives and keep the Broncos' pass rush at bay. \n\nKey matchup: Can the Jets' offensive line protect their quarterback against Denver's league-leading 21 sacks?

Their turnover margin of -6 suggests they're more generous than a charity fundraiser. \n\nFans are fooling themselves if they think this is just a 'rough patch'. This is a **systemic meltdown** where every unit - offense, defense, special teams - seems committed to finding new and innovative ways to lose football games.
