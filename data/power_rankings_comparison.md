## Algorithm 6: AI-Enhanced Rankings

**Methodology:** Weighted Composite + AI adjustments (±3 spots max)
- AI Model: Sonnet 3.7

| Rank | Team | Record | Base | AI Adj | Reasoning |
|------|------|--------|------|--------|-----------|
|  1 | DET | 4-2   |    1 |          | No adjustment needed |
|  2 | IND | 5-1   |    2 |          | No adjustment needed |
|  3 | KC  | 3-3   |    5 | (5→3)    | Despite their 3-3 record, KC remains an elite team |
|  4 | DEN | 4-2   |    4 |          | No adjustment needed |
|  4 | PIT | 4-1   |    6 | (6→4)    | Pittsburgh's defense has been dominant, and their  |
|  5 | TB  | 5-1   |    3 | (3→5)    | Tampa Bay's +14 point differential is much lower t |
|  7 | NE  | 4-2   |    7 |          | No adjustment needed |
|  8 | BUF | 4-2   |    8 |          | No adjustment needed |
|  9 | GB  | 3-1-1 |    9 |          | No adjustment needed |
| 10 | LAR | 4-2   |   10 |          | No adjustment needed |
| 10 | SEA | 4-2   |   12 | (12→10)  | Seattle's +49 point differential is elite and matc |
| 11 | HOU | 2-3   |   14 | (14→11)  | Houston's +47 point differential is among the best |
| 13 | PHI | 4-2   |   11 | (11→13)  | Philadelphia's negative point differential (-1) an |
| 13 | JAX | 4-2   |   13 |          | No adjustment needed |
| 15 | WAS | 3-3   |   15 |          | No adjustment needed |

**AI Analysis:** These rankings generally reflect team quality well, but a few adjustments were needed based on advanced metrics versus record. Teams like Seattle and Houston appear undervalued based on their point differentials, while Tampa Bay's high ranking seems inflated given their relatively small scoring margin. Kansas City remains an elite team despite their .500 record. Philadelphia's negative point differential and recent poor performance suggest they may be ranked too high.
