You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_records**: AUTHORITATIVE overall season records (wins-losses-ties) for both teams - USE THIS for team records
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **gameInfo**: Venue, weather conditions
- **team_profiles/head_coaches/coordinators**: Coaching context and stadium information for each team
- **injury_report**: Extended injury notes with detailed comments and last-updated timestamps
- **recent_news**: Latest team-specific headlines
- **depth_chart_alerts**: Notable starter/lineup status changes from the latest depth chart snapshot
- **recent_form**: Last five game results for each team
- **event_context**: Broadcast, neutral-site, attendance, and special event notes pulled from the scoreboard feed

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2025/2026 NFL SEASON

The defending Super Bowl champions will be quickly challenged to show they've made some strides. The Eagles, after a humbling <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jalen-hurts-interception-eagles-loss-631d6017d8bac50326859b850af4b35f\">34-17 defeat</a> in prime time by the division-rival <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants\">New York Giants</a> and a 10-day break to reexamine their lineups, mindsets and schemes, play at Minnesota on Sunday. \u201cThere was a little bit of rest and relaxation, and then there was a lot of trying to figure things out,\u201d coach Nick Sirianni said. \u201cWe have a lot of thoughts, a lot of things that we want to put into action.\u201d The Vikings (3-2) are coming off even more time for rest and reflection, after splitting an historic <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nfl-international-games-vikings-3caed2affdf31ce5626d95dc81b3ce3d\">two-game road trip to Europe</a> and taking their much-needed bye week. They not only have multiple strengths that should match up well for them with some of the early season vulnerabilities that have been on display by the Eagles, but they're much healthier as a team now after a series of injuries sidelined several key players. The Eagles (4-2) must try to fix an offense that ranks third-worst in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\">NFL</a> in total yards against a Vikings defense allowing the second-fewest passing yards per game in the league. \u201cThey\u2019re the defending champs,\u201d Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores said. \u201cI\u2019m not really looking at the numbers, just the history and the talent that\u2019s there, the explosiveness that\u2019s there. We\u2019ve got a big challenge ahead of us.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929630/saquon-barkley\">Saquon Barkley</a>, a 2,000-yard rusher in 2024, hasn't come close to an 100-yard game yet. Quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a> hasn't played like the Super Bowl MVP he was last season. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047646/aj-brown\">A.J. Brown</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241478/devonta-smith\">DeVonta Smith</a>, both multiple-time 1,000-yard receivers, have both expressed discontent with their role. After the loss to the Giants, six-time Pro Bowl right tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15797/lane-johnson\">Lane Johnson</a> <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/eagles-analysis-hurts-barkley-giants-33253abab0f2aa9c4aa4e037a86469c2\">ripped the \u201cpredictability\u201d of the offense</a>. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ve been very stagnant offensively,\" Johnson said. \"We\u2019ve really put the defense in a bind the last two weeks.\u201d <hl2>Wentz's career comes full circle</hl2> One of the many injuries the Vikings have had to navigate was a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/vikings-quarterbacks-mccarthy-40ff8f3566ff21c1281d1051daed4b7c\">high ankle sprain</a> that has sidelined quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4433970/jj-mccarthy\">J.J. McCarthy</a> for the last three games. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2573079/carson-wentz\">Carson Wentz</a> has filled in admirably, having joined the team just six weeks ago, and Vikings coach <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2146711/kevin-o'connell\">Kevin O'Connell</a> has stressed his desire that McCarthy not only demonstrate he's fully healthy but fully ready to resume running the offense before he's reinstalled as the starter. That puts Wentz in position to face the team that drafted him second overall in 2016 and replaced him with Hurts five years later. Having made Minnesota his sixth stop in six seasons, however, Wentz is too far removed from his time in Philadelphia to take any extra emotion into the game Sunday. Johnson, Hurts and left tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4334215/jordan-mailata\">Jordan Mailata</a> are the only three offensive players still around from Wentz's time. \u201cThere are still guys in that organization, a lot of good people that I still have a lot of care for and respect for,\" Wentz said, \"but at the same time that feels like multiple lifetimes ago.\u201d <hl2>Who's snapping the ball?</hl2> The injury bug in Minnesota has hit the offensive line the hardest, but the patchwork group delivered a remarkable performance in the comeback win over Cleveland in London. Most notable was the job done by fill-in center <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3930270/blake-brandel\">Blake Brandel</a>, who was the starting left guard last season and originally a tackle who had never before played in the middle. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578475/ryan-kelly\">Ryan Kelly</a>, the original starter, is on injured reserve with a concussion. Backup <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362010/michael-jurgens\">Michael Jurgens</a> was sidelined the previous game with a hamstring injury. \u201cThe way Blake handled this game, I think we might be looking at a situation where this could be his best position of all five across the line,\u201d offensive coordinator Wes Phillips said. <hl2>Hold on tight</hl2> <hl2 /> The Vikings have lost four fumbles in five games, including two against the Browns that were big momentum killers. The first one set up a touchdown for the Browns. \u201cBall security has to be a premium for the way we're going to win games,\u201d O'Connell said. The last time the Vikings faced the Eagles, a 34-28 loss in Philadelphia in Week 2 of the 2023 season, they lost four fumbles. <hl2>Play-calling status quo</hl2> First-year offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo has been an easy target for frustrated Eagles fans, but Sirianni refused to second-guess or micromanage his lieutenant. \u201cNot in this sport is it ever on one person, and we\u2019re not in the business of assigning blame,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cI know that we live in a world that wants to assign blame, point the finger, but that\u2019s not the reality of what good teams do.\u201d <hl2>Corner backs to the wall</hl2> The Eagles have only three interceptions in six games, just one by a defensive back: rookie safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4602197/andrew-mukuba\">Andrew Mukuba</a>. While <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4682618/cooper-dejean\">Cooper DeJean</a>'s performance has been steady since he capped his rookie season with an interception return for a touchdown in the Super Bowl, the rest of the cornerbacks have been uneven at best, with neither <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428992/kelee-ringo\">Kelee Ringo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120347/adoree'-jackson\">Adoree' Jackson</a> taking hold of the spot opposite <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4686273/quinyon-mitchell\">Quinyon Mitchell</a>. That's a recipe for trouble against a dangerous group of Vikings pass-catchers led by All-Pro <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4262921/justin-jefferson\">Justin Jefferson</a>. \"We\u2019ve got to settle in and find somebody out there that we can rely on,\u201d defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said. \u201cI think we have the guys that can do that. We've just got to get them playing better.\u201d ------ AP Sports Writer Dan Gelston contributed from Philadelphia. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\">https://apnews.com/hub/NFL</a>", "title": "Eagles emerge from sobering self-reflection, eager to see what's been fixed vs. well-rested Vikings", "video": []}, "format": {"overtime": {"clock": 600.0, "displayName": "sudden-death", "periods": 1, "slug": "sudden-death"}, "regulation": {"clock": 900.0, "displayName": "Quarter", "periods": 4, "slug": "quarter"}}, "gameInfo": {"venue": {"address": {"city": "Minneapolis", "country": "USA", "state": "MN", "zipCode": "55415"}, "fullName": "U.S. Bank Stadium", "grass": false, "id": "5239"}, "weather": {"conditionId": "1", "gust": 25, "highTemperature": 54, "lowTemperature": 54, "precipitation": 0, "temperature": 54}}, "injuries": [{"injuries": [{"athlete": {"collegeAthlete": {}, "displayName": "Brian O'Neill", "fullName": "Brian O'Neill", "id": "3123954", "jersey": "75", "lastName": "O'Neill", "position": {"abbreviation": "OT", "displayName": "Offensive Tackle", "name": "Offensive Tackle"}, "shortName": "B.
