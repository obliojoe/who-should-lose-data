You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_records**: AUTHORITATIVE overall season records (wins-losses-ties) for both teams - USE THIS for team records
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **gameInfo**: Venue, weather conditions
- **team_profiles/head_coaches/coordinators**: Coaching context and stadium information for each team
- **injury_report**: Extended injury notes with detailed comments and last-updated timestamps
- **recent_news**: Latest team-specific headlines
- **depth_chart_alerts**: Notable starter/lineup status changes from the latest depth chart snapshot
- **recent_form**: Last five game results for each team
- **event_context**: Broadcast, neutral-site, attendance, and special event notes pulled from the scoreboard feed

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2025/2026 NFL SEASON

Seattle is 3-0 on the road this season but 1-2 at Lumen Field, a loud stadium that not so long ago was one of the team\u2019s prized advantages. The Seahawks host the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/hou/houston-texans\">Houston Texans</a> (2-3) on Monday night, hoping to get some of that Lumen Field mojo going. The home slump became apparent last season, when the Seahawks went 3-6 at Lumen, their worst record in Seattle since 2008. \u201cWe have to win at home, We have to defend our home turf. We know that,\u201d Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said after the Seahawks fell 38-35 to Tampa Bay in Seattle two weeks ago. \"It\u2019s really important that we play better at home. It\u2019s been an important emphasis since I was hired. Hasn\u2019t come to life yet. We\u2019re determined to make it come to life.\u201d Fortunately for the Seahawks, they're winning on the road. Seattle was coming off a 20-12 win at Jacksonville, which extended the team's franchise record to nine straight road wins. Quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold\">Sam Darnold</a> threw for 295 yards and a pair of touchdowns in the victory. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430878/jaxon-smith-njigba\">Jaxon Smith-Njigba</a> finished with eight catches for 162 yards and a 61-yard TD reception in the second quarter. Houston had a bye week following a 44-10 road win over the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens\">Baltimore Ravens</a> before the break. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432577/cj-stroud\">C.J. Stroud</a> was the AFC Offensive Player of the Week after throwing for 244 yards and a season-high four touchdowns in the victory. The Texans lost their first three games of the season, but have rebounded with a pair of wins. \u201cIt\u2019s still early in the season,\" Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. \"A lot of teams had a lot of really good starts to the season. But we all know, and it\u2019s our focus, it\u2019s all about how you finish the season. It\u2019s all about how your team grows throughout the season. Just because you have a great start doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be a great finish. You just continue to work, control what you can control and you truly focus on one game at a time. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d <hl2>Doing it all</hl2> Safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241223/jalen-pitre\">Jalen Pitre</a> is off to a great start this season and leads the Texans with three interceptions after he had two in Houston\u2019s game against the Ravens. The fourth-year player does a little bit of everything for the Texans and Ryans said he\u2019s one of the reasons their defense has been successful this season. \u201cWhether that\u2019s blitzing, whether it\u2019s playing in coverage, whether it\u2019s playing back deep \u2014 all three levels of the defense, Jalen provides us that flexibility to be able to move him around wherever we need to put him each week,\u201d Ryans said. \u201cSo, to have a player who is as smart as he is and as reliable as he is, it really gives you a comfort as a play-caller.\u201d <hl2>Closing it out</hl2> Seattle held Jacksonville to 273 yards, including just 59 yards rushing. The defense had seven sacks and forced three straight fourth-quarter punts. Macdonald said it was important for the D to prove it could close out games. \u201cIt\u2019s been an emphasis for us,\u201d Macdonald said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t shying away from it. Our guys were awesome. I think you could sense it on the sideline that they wanted the opportunity to go out there and go play, and that\u2019s all you can ask for as a coach.\" <hl2>Chubb and Marks</hl2> The Texans have used both <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128720/nick-chubb\">Nick Chubb</a> and rookie <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429059/woody-marks\">Woody Marks</a> at running back this season with star <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116385/joe-mixon\">Joe Mixon</a> out indefinitely with a foot injury. Chubb leads the team with 249 yards rushing and two touchdowns and Marks has 137 yards rushing and a TD run. Marks has also been a playmaker out of the backfield and has 96 yards receiving with another score. The Texans have also been impressed with the blocking of Marks, a fourth-round pick from USC. \u201cHe\u2019s put it on tape that he\u2019s a violent protector and can get underneath people and knows where to go,\u201d offensive coordinator Nick Caley said. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been very pleased with his development. It\u2019s been steady since he\u2019s been here, and we\u2019ll just continue to keep it on that trajectory.\u201d ------ AP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\">https://apnews.com/hub/nfl</a>", "title": "Seahawks look to boost home record on Monday night against the Texans", "video": [{"ad": {"bundle": "sportscenter", "sport": "nfl"}, "caption": "Rich Eisen previews the Texans vs. Seahawks matchup in Week 7.", "categories": [{"description": "Houston Texans @ Seattle Seahawks", "event": {"description": "Houston Texans @ Seattle Seahawks", "id": 401772826, "league": "nfl", "sport": "football"}, "eventId": 401772826}, {"description": "Seattle Seahawks", "id": 1693, "sportId": 28, "team": {"description": "Seattle Seahawks", "id": 26}, "teamId": 26}, {"description": "Houston Texans", "id": 3053, "sportId": 28, "team": {"description": "Houston Texans", "id": 34}, "teamId": 34}, {"description": "Team Boost", "id": 664674}, {"description": "NFL", "id": 9572, "league": {"abbreviation": "NFL", "description": "NFL", "id": 28}, "leagueId": 28, "sportId": 28}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "cerebroId": "68f291b9c9546c6cde345910", "contributingPartner": "wsc", "contributingSystem": "wsc", "dataSourceIdentifier": "c3721af7850bf", "description": "Rich Eisen previews the Texans vs. Seahawks matchup in Week 7.", "duration": 53, "gameId": 401772826, "headline": "Rich Eisen breaks down Texans-Seahawks Monday Night matchup", "id": 46628382, "originalPublishDate": "2025-10-17T18:58:00Z", "pccId": "f0f35e09-55a3-4a3e-a75d-c0a40abca2e0", "posterImages": {"default": {"height": 324, "width": 576}, "full": {}, "square": {}, "vertical": {}, "verticalFirstFrame": {}, "wide": {}}, "source": "espn", "syndicatable": true, "timeRestrictions": {"embargoDate": "2025-10-17T18:58:00Z", "expirationDate": "2025-10-20T04:00:00Z"}, "title": "Rich Eisen breaks down Texans-Seahawks Monday Night matchup", "videoRatio": "16:9,9:16"}]}, "format": {"overtime": {"clock": 600.0, "displayName": "sudden-death", "periods": 1, "slug": "sudden-death"}, "regulation": {"clock": 900.0, "displayName": "Quarter", "periods": 4, "slug": "quarter"}}, "gameInfo": {"venue": {"address": {"city": "Seattle", "country": "USA", "state": "WA", "zipCode": "98134"}, "fullName": "Lumen Field", "grass": false, "id": "3673"}, "weather": {"conditionId": "38", "gust": 5, "highTemperature": 55, "lowTemperature": 55, "precipitation": 0, "temperature": 55}}, "injuries": [{"injuries": [{"athlete": {"collegeAthlete": {}, "displayName": "Julian Love", "fullName": "Julian Love", "id": "4046675", "jersey": "20", "lastName": "Love", "position": {"abbreviation": "S", "displayName": "Safety", "name": "Safety"}, "shortName": "J.
