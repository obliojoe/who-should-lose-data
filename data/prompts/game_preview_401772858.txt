You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **boxscore.teams[].statistics**: Basic per-game averages from ESPN

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2024/2025 NFL SEASON

"Dallas Cowboys", "NFL"], "story": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers\">Carolina Panthers</a> running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038815/rico-dowdle\">Rico Dowdle</a> had a message for his former team after rushing for a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/dolphins-panthers-score-60cb34613958e624d5a2d207e57fc23c\">career-best 206 yards</a> last Sunday against the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a>. \u201cBetter buckle up,\u201d Dowdle warned the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a>, who have the 32nd-ranked defense. Dowdle didn't back down from that message this week, adding: \"It\u2019s going to be a very physical game. I take pride in that. Buckle your chinstraps up. I will be coming.\u2033 The Cowboys insist they'll be ready. \u201cHe gotta back it up,\u201d Cowboys defensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3122752/kenny-clark\">Kenny Clark</a> said. \u201cI\u2019m not much into talking. He ain\u2019t played nobody like us and we ain\u2019t played them.\u201d Dowdle should be plenty motivated. He spent five seasons with the Cowboys (2-2-1) and eclipsed 1,000 yards rushing last year, but team owner/general manager Jerry Jones opted not to re-sign Dowdle and go in a different direction. Dowdle found limited options in the free agent market and wound up taking a backup role behind <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241416/chuba-hubbard\">Chuba Hubbard</a> in Carolina. With Hubbard out last week with a calf injury, Dowdle got his first start for Carolina and turned in the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/panthers-rico-dowdle-0de6a8187649c53b0dc5943faf025162\">third-best rushing performance in franchise history</a> as the Panthers (2-3) battled back from 17 points down to beat Miami 27-24. He had two runs of longer than 50 yards and also scored. Hubbard will miss a second straight game after being ruled out for the game on Friday. Hubbard, who ran for nearly 1,200 last yards and 10 TDs last season, didn't practice all week. Coach <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17762/dave-canales\">Dave Canales</a> said earlier in the week he knows Hubbard is \u201cchomping at the bit\u201d to get back, but wants to make sure he isn't rushing back too soon. Canales said even if Hubbard did return, Dowdle would still play. \"It\u2019s a great feeling for me,\" Canales said. \u201cI look down on the call sheet \u2014 I don\u2019t have to worry about who\u2019s in there. To know we\u2019ve got two solid backs that we love, it just allows us to continue to play our brand of football and get a fresh set of legs in there that can execute. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure out how to use both guys when that time comes.\u2033 <hl2>Plug and play</hl2> The Cowboys also are coming off a productive day on the ground. Dallas rushed for a season-high 180 yards in a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cowboys-jets-score-prescott-e0a42f21afef167aaa24f46d70d953be\">dominant 37-22 win over the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a></a> despite missing four starting offensive linemen. Both left-side starters could be back in tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4609048/tyler-guyton\">Tyler Guyton</a> (concussion) and guard <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2570519/tyler-smith\">Tyler Smith</a> (knee). Rookie right guard <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685263/tyler-booker\">Tyler Booker</a> has also been out. Center <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426663/cooper-beebe\">Cooper Beebe</a> (foot) will miss his fourth game on injured reserve against the Panthers, then be eligible to return. \u201cI still can\u2019t think of one where I\u2019ve ever gone in before, the different starting offensive linemen,\u201d coach Brian Schottenheimer said. \u201cWe have to come up with plans that we think feature what they do well along with attacking your opponent. But at the end of the day, the players are the magic.\u201d <hl2>Not slim Pickens</hl2> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426354/george-pickens\">George Pickens</a> has played two games without new sidekick \u2013 and incumbent No. 1 Dallas receiver \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241389/ceedee-lamb\">CeeDee Lamb</a>, who's nursing a high ankle sprain. It appears Lamb will be sidelined again, although he\u2019s getting closer to a return. The first game without Lamb, Pickens had one of the two best games of his career with eight catches for 134 yards and two touchdowns in a 40-40 tie with Green Bay. In last week\u2019s 37-22 victory over the New York Jets, Pickens had a 43-yard TD grab for a 30-3 lead. Pickens came to Dallas in an offseason trade from Pittsburgh, where Pickens was prone to emotional outbursts and penalties that once prompted coach Mike Tomlin to say the 24-year-old needed to grow up. The future has brightened considerably for a 2022 second-round pick in the final year of his rookie contract. \u201cI feel like I was always having fun,\u201d Pickens said. \u201cI just feel like the narrative never showed me having fun. I feel like right now it\u2019s a good thing for the team.\u201d <hl2>Bring the pressure</hl2> The Panthers had just two sacks through the first four games, which rookie <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429166/princely-umanmielen\">Princely Umanmielen</a> and others called embarrassing. The result was a players-only defensive team meeting before last week's game \u2014 one that seemed to work. Carolina had three sacks in the win over the Dolphins with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3054857/a'shawn-robinson\">A'Shawn Robinson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035495/derrick-brown\">Derrick Brown</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036063/patrick-jones-ii\">Patrick Jones II</a> all getting to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241479/tua-tagovailoa\">Tua Tagovailoa</a>. The Panthers are hoping to build on that success this week, but it won't be easy. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a> has been one of the better protected QBs in the league. He has been sacked seven times through five games and his 3.4% sack rate on drop-backs is the fifth-lowest mark in the league. <hl2>Legette's confidence</hl2> After being held to 8 yards on four catches in his first four games and missing the next two due to a hamstring injury, Panthers wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430034/xavier-legette\">Xavier Legette</a> was lacking some confidence. The Panthers hope that has changed after Legette caught a key touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685720/bryce-young\">Bryce Young</a> last week that helped spark a comeback from a 17-point deficit against Miami. \u201cYou hope those opportunities come up where the coverage points to a 1-on-1 chance for a guy to make a play,\u201d Panthers offensive coordinator Brad Idzik said. \u201cI think the throw from Bryce, having to get that ball out, knowing at the time of the release of the throw, the leverage might not have been what he wanted, but he knew Xavier was going to make that play. \"And then Xavier, to go track that thing, a low ball, that was a really remarkable catch.\u201d <hl2>Carolina home cooking</hl2> The Panthers are 2-0 at home and Canales is excited to be at Bank of America Stadium for the first time in back-to-back games this year. \u201cI mean, speaking personally, it\u2019s just spending time with my family, spending time with my wife and my kids throughout the week,\u201d Canales said. \u201cAnd where you normally get on a plane sometime on Saturday afternoon, and I get to go see soccer and, you know, those types of things that just put you in a good state of mind.\u201d ------ AP Sports Writer Schuyler Dixon is Dallas contributed to this report. \u2014 AP NFL: <a
