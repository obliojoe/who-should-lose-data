You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_records**: AUTHORITATIVE overall season records (wins-losses-ties) for both teams - USE THIS for team records
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **gameInfo**: Venue, weather conditions
- **team_profiles/head_coaches/coordinators**: Coaching context and stadium information for each team
- **injury_report**: Extended injury notes with detailed comments and last-updated timestamps
- **recent_news**: Latest team-specific headlines
- **depth_chart_alerts**: Notable starter/lineup status changes from the latest depth chart snapshot
- **recent_form**: Last five game results for each team
- **event_context**: Broadcast, neutral-site, attendance, and special event notes pulled from the scoreboard feed

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2025/2026 NFL SEASON

He was the No. 1 pick in the 2023 NFL draft, hoped by the Panthers to be the quarterback to help lead the franchise back to respectability, the playoffs and perhaps someday much more. Well, small steps first. The Panthers (3-3) head to New York to play the winless Jets (0-6) on Sunday and look to win three straight games for the first time with Young as their starting quarterback. They also haven't had a .500 record this deep into a season since they were 5-5 in Cam Newton's second stint with the team in 2021. \u201cSo proud of this group that just continues to fight and scratch and claw and just get it done,\u201d coach <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17762/dave-canales\">Dave Canales</a> said after the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cowboys-panthers-score-dowdle-0e5945f279125e498a3cf5148f4668ec\">Panthers' 30-27 win over the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a></a> last Sunday. There's a feeling among the players that things are different now for a team that has a franchise-worst seven-year playoff drought, tied with Atlanta for the NFL's second-longest active skid behind only the Jets. Young agreed with guard <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362647/damien-lewis\">Damien Lewis</a>, who posted on social media that he feels a culture change is underway in Carolina. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re definitely continuing to build and grow in the right direction,\u201d Young said. \u201cI\u2019m embracing the culture, embracing the ownership and all the little things, and I think us being able to come into our own, it\u2019s been great. It\u2019s been great to be a part of, and it\u2019s been great to be a leader through it. \"So, you know, there\u2019s still work to do. Still so much for us to build off of.\u201d The Panthers will have to solve their road woes if they hope to keep things rolling. Carolina is 0-3 away from Bank of America Stadium and been outscored 95-45 in those games. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jets-glenn-fields-london-winless-302b05297f08193a12bc22d57f17229a\">Jets are 0-6 for the third time in franchise history</a> and will try to avoid joining the 1996 and 2020 squads as the only teams to drop their first seven games. Aaron Glenn is the first Jets coach to begin his tenure with six losses, and fans already frustrated with the team's 14-year playoff drought are already losing patience. \u201cI understand how it looks on the outside, and the thing is, I told you guys and I told the fans, man, do not let go of the rope,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cThe thing I know we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re trying to build a solid foundation so we can consistently try to win.\u201d <hl2>Split backfield?</hl2> Panthers running back <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/panthers-analysis-week-6-1751f1419d54de93afb725ed82b5ecf9\"><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038815/rico-dowdle\">Rico Dowdle</a> has been dominant</a> the past two weeks, racking up 389 yards on the ground and 473 yards from scrimmage \u2014 both franchise records for a two-game span. But with regular starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241416/chuba-hubbard\">Chuba Hubbard</a> set to return this week from a calf injury, Dowdle could get fewer reps. Canales has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/carolina-panthers-rico-dowdle-chuba-hubbard-b5a2bda74d41ee59f04a9a7e3a5e607f\">remained quiet on his plans</a> on who\u2019ll receive the bulk of carries, but i <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/panthers-hubbard-443b19aff4414d5cfbbd18934a116909\">nsisted Dowdle will remain</a> part of the mix. \u201cI think he\u2019s earned everything that he\u2019s done in the last two weeks,\u201d Canales said of Dowdle. \u201cHe\u2019s earned the right to help this team, and he will. We\u2019ll find a way to do that. How we do that specifically, I don\u2019t wanna really share those details of it.\u201d <hl2>Things can only go up</hl2> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a> went 9 of 17 for just 45 yards and was sacked nine times, a result of holding onto the ball too long at times, in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/broncos-jets-score-london-e4c2410717f7b70f8a581ac0c5f09960\">New York's 13-11 loss to Denver</a> in London last Sunday. The Jets also finished with a franchise-worst minus-10 net yards passing. Still, Glenn is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jets-analysis-glenn-fields-a1d1505da968f03b062b987eab131b84\">sticking with Fields</a> as his starter, looking for the quarterback and coordinator Tanner Engstrand's struggling unit to bounce back. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just learn from my mistakes from last game,\u201d Fields said, \u201cand definitely play better this week, for sure.\u201d <hl2>Wilson watch</hl2> Fields and the offense could have an even tougher time getting on track if star wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569618/garrett-wilson\">Garrett Wilson</a> is sidelined. Wilson is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jets-garrett-wilson-mangold-38732220e293a0b3f9f2b539a2022b4d\">dealing with a knee injury</a> that kept him out of practice all week. He's listed as doubtful for the game. The fourth-year receiver leads New York with 36 catches for 395 yards and four touchdowns. No. 2 wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115306/josh-reynolds\">Josh Reynolds</a> was removed from the injury report on Friday after being slowed by a hip ailment. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128390/allen-lazard\">Allen Lazard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2310331/tyler-johnson\">Tyler Johnson</a> and rookie <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429105/arian-smith\">Arian Smith</a> are the only healthy wide receivers on the active roster. <hl2>Coker's return</hl2> Panthers wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4695883/jalen-coker\">Jalen Coker</a>, who carved a niche last season as an undrafted rookie with 32 receptions for 478 yards and two touchdowns, is set to make his season debut as the team\u2019s slot receiver. Coker missed the first six games with a quadriceps injury suffered leading up to the season opener, which he called \u201creally unfortunate timing.\u201d The Panthers have been careful to make sure Coker is completely healed and that his conditioning is at a point where he can play the entire game and be a contributor and not be on a snap count. <hl2>Edge rushers needed</hl2> The Panthers lost outside linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036063/patrick-jones-ii\">Patrick Jones II</a>, one of their top pass rushers, for the season with a lower back injury this week. Carolina is expected to turn to rookies <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4833355/nic-scourton\">Nic Scourton</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429166/princely-umanmielen\">Princely Umanmielen</a>, the team\u2019s second- and third-round picks, to replace Jones. Both have shown promise, but are now expected to get expanded roles. ------ AP Sports Writer Steve Reed in Charlotte, North Carolina, contributed. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\">https://apnews.com/hub/NFL</a>", "title": "Panthers going for 3 wins in a row for the first time with Bryce Young as QB when they face 0-6 Jets", "video": []}, "format": {"overtime": {"clock": 600.0, "displayName": "sudden-death", "periods": 1, "slug": "sudden-death"}, "regulation": {"clock": 900.0, "displayName": "Quarter", "periods": 4, "slug": "quarter"}}, "gameInfo": {"venue": {"address": {"city": "East Rutherford", "country": "USA", "state": "NJ", "zipCode": "07073"}, "fullName": "MetLife Stadium", "grass": false, "id": "3839"}, "weather": {"conditionId": "4", "gust": 32, "highTemperature": 70, "lowTemperature": 70, "precipitation": 0, "temperature": 70}}, "injuries": [{"injuries": [{"athlete": {"displayName": "Qwan'tez Stiggers", "fullName": "Qwan'tez Stiggers", "id": "5208977", "jersey": "37", "lastName": "Stiggers", "position": {"abbreviation": "CB", "displayName": "Cornerback", "name": "Cornerback"}, "shortName": "Q.
