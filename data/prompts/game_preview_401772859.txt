You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **boxscore.teams[].statistics**: Basic per-game averages from ESPN

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2024/2025 NFL SEASON

NFL Odds: Raiders by 4 1/2. Against the spread: Titans 2-3; Raiders 1-4. Series record: Raiders lead 30-22. Last meeting: Titans beat Raiders 24-22 in Nashville on Sept. 25, 2022. Last week: Titans beat Cardinals 22-21; Raiders lost 40-6 to Colts. Titans offense: overall (31), rush (28t), pass (32), scoring (31t).

Turnover differential: Titans plus-1; Raiders minus-6. <hl2>Titans player to watch</hl2> QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4688380/cam-ward\">Cam Ward</a>. The No. 1 overall pick is coming off his first NFL win and his best game yet as a pro. Ward threw for 193 of his 265 yards in the fourth quarter as Tennessee rallied from a 21-6 deficit in the final 15 minutes. The rookie has to start games like he finished last week to give the Titans a chance at consecutive wins. <hl2>Raiders player to watch</hl2> QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15864/geno-smith\">Geno Smith</a>. His nine interceptions lead the NFL and he looks more like the quarterback who struggled in his early years with the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> than the player who resurrected his career in Seattle. Coach Pete Carroll is giving Smith every chance to snap out of his slump. <hl2>Key matchup</hl2> Raiders RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4890973/ashton-jeanty\">Ashton Jeanty</a> vs. Titans run defense. Jeanty has shown over the past two games why Las Vegas drafted him sixth overall this year and now he goes against the league's 30th-ranked rush defense. If Jeanty can help establish a consistent running game, that will take pressure off Smith. But if the Titans bottle up the back, they will limit what the Raiders are able to accomplish by forcing Smith to pass his way to victory. <hl2>Key injuries</hl2> Titans: K <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3124084/joey-slye\">Joey Slye</a> (calf) will not play. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128444/matthew-wright\">Matthew Wright</a>, who was signed to the practice squad this week, will be promoted to the active roster. ...

The Titans have won the past two matchups. Those victories came on the heels of a three-game series winning streak by the Raiders. ... The Raiders are 4-0 in playoff games against the Titans/Houston Oilers, but the most recent one was Jan. 19, 2003.

Las Vegas faces one of the NFL's most ineffective offenses, and the Raiders' defense often has performed well even when placed in difficult situations. Plus, the defense figures to be motivated after the Colts moved almost at will against it. ------ AP NFL: <a
