You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_records**: AUTHORITATIVE overall season records (wins-losses-ties) for both teams - USE THIS for team records
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **gameInfo**: Venue, weather conditions
- **team_profiles/head_coaches/coordinators**: Coaching context and stadium information for each team
- **injury_report**: Extended injury notes with detailed comments and last-updated timestamps
- **recent_news**: Latest team-specific headlines
- **depth_chart_alerts**: Notable starter/lineup status changes from the latest depth chart snapshot
- **recent_form**: Last five game results for each team
- **event_context**: Broadcast, neutral-site, attendance, and special event notes pulled from the scoreboard feed

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2025/2026 NFL SEASON

The Giants (2-4) have scored touchdowns on their opening drives in all three games Dart has started after Brian Daboll benched <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a>. Skattebo scored a trio of touchdowns in New York's win over Philadelphia last week. Vance Joseph, whose defense just held the Jets to 82 yards of offense and limited <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362887/justin-fields\">Justin Fields</a> to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/broncos-analysis-nix-bonitto-surtain-136a982847e137fca7ce6ce7e35dcb00\">minus-10 net passing yards</a> a week after the Broncos beat the Eagles and ended the defending Super Bowl champs' long home winning streak, is certainly impressed. \u201cI see two guys that are playing with great confidence that's changed their teams' hope moving forward,\u201d said Joseph, the Broncos' defensive coordinator. \u201cThe quarterback is making great plays with his legs and his arm. He's given them a reason to play hard. And the runner, man, he is old school, runs behind his pads, he's breaking tackles, he's confident. He's given them juice.\u201d That's the formula for shifting a franchise's fortunes, Joseph suggested. \u201cSo, those two guys are obviously a big part of that and it's fun to watch them play,\" Joseph said. Dart, a first-round pick from Ole Miss, has faced a brutal schedule and key injuries but hasn't seemed the least bit flummoxed. \u201cWell, first of all, I have a ton of confidence in everybody that\u2019s here,\u201d Dart said. Including himself. Broncos linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040608/jonathon-cooper\">Jonathon Cooper</a>, who earned the latest AFC defensive player of the week honors a week after his teammate <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360259/nik-bonitto\">Nik Bonitto</a> won it, had a little bit of an edge when asked about his impressions of Dart this week. \u201cYeah, I mean, he\u2019s a young guy. He\u2019s feeling himself a little bit. He\u2019s out there running around, he\u2019s got the chain on, he\u2019s dancing,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou know, looks like everybody needs something. But we went against QBs who have run around the pocket and everything, try to do stuff with their legs. \"So, it ain\u2019t nothing we haven\u2019t seen.\u201d After getting sacked five times in his debut, Dart has been sacked just three times in 68 drop-backs over the last two weeks. He'll face a defense that leads the league with 30 sacks and is coming off a game in which Justin Fields was dropped nine times, one shy of the franchise record. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a really good test for us, one that I think we\u2019re all excited for,\" Dart said, \"just because, in my mind, I see them as one of the best defenses in the entire league.\u201d <hl2>Remembering D.T.</hl2> The Broncos are honoring their Super Bowl 50 championship team Sunday along with the late Demaryius Thomas, who'll be inducted at halftime into the team's ring of fame. \u201cOne time, I had a hard talk with Derrick Wolfe and he was like, \u2018Coach, don\u2019t mess with him,'\u201d Joseph, who was Thomas' head coach in Denver, recounted with a laugh. \u201cYou're probably right. That's great advice. But he was a team-first guy, he was a great teammate and he always gave me great advice as a head coach.\u201d <hl2>Another dominant defense</hl2> The Giants\u2019 defense is showing flashes, too. Broncos offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said of New York's defensive front: \u201cThey've got like four werewolves in there and it's a challenge.\" Cor\u2019Dale Flott picked off <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a> in the fourth quarter of the Giants\u2019 upset of Philadelphia after the pass rush put a lot of pressure on the reigning Super Bowl MVP. Daboll told defensive coordinator Shane Bowen to be aggressive, and with players such as Dexter Lawrence, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035631/brian-burns\">Brian Burns</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426326/kayvon-thibodeaux\">Kayvon Thibodeaux</a> and rookie <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4725996/abdul-carter\">Abdul Carter</a>, the talent is there to make a difference. \u201cYou want to be able to dictate on defense because the offense has so much at their arsenal where they can motion and move and different groups and everything else,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cThat\u2019s something moving forward as we go: just finding ways to do that and being timely with it when we do.\u201d <hl2>Russ's return</hl2> <hl2 /> Dart\u2019s emergence after Daboll\u2019s decision to start the 22-year-old has relegated Wilson to backup QB status. Wilson spent the 2022 and \u201823 seasons in Denver before he was jettisoned and landed in Pittsburgh last year. He missed the Steelers\u2019 game in Denver with a foot injury in 2024. Daboll was asked this week why Wilson is still in that role as QB2, ahead of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969939/jameis-winston\">Jameis Winston</a>, and said only, \u201cHe\u2019s our backup quarterback.\u201d <hl2>Left guard turnstile</hl2> Sam Palczewski is expected to start at left guard for Denver after the Broncos lost both starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4037650/ben-powers\">Ben Powers</a> (biceps) and his backup <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3921936/matt-peart\">Matt Peart</a> (knee) the last two weeks. ------ AP Sports Writer Stephen Whyno contributed from East Rutherford, New Jersey. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\">https://apnews.com/hub/nfl</a>", "title": "Giants' spark plug rookies Jaxson Dart and Cam Skattebo to test Broncos' top defense", "video": [{"ad": {"bundle": "sportscenter", "sport": "nfl"}, "caption": "The \"Get Up\" crew discusses why the Giants' Week 7 matchup vs. the Broncos is pivotal for the team.", "categories": [{"athlete": {"description": "Jaxson Dart", "id": 4689114}, "athleteId": 4689114, "description": "Jaxson Dart", "id": 491567, "sportId": 28}, {"athlete": {"description": "Cam Skattebo", "id": 4696981}, "athleteId": 4696981, "description": "Cam Skattebo", "id": 450385, "sportId": 28}, {"description": "New York Giants", "id": 1352, "sportId": 28, "team": {"description": "New York Giants", "id": 19}, "teamId": 19}, {"description": "New York Giants @ Denver Broncos", "event": {"description": "New York Giants @ Denver Broncos", "id": 401772757, "league": "nfl", "sport": "football"}, "eventId": 401772757}, {"description": "Denver Broncos", "id": 2432, "sportId": 28, "team": {"description": "Denver Broncos", "id": 7}, "teamId": 7}, {"description": "Team Boost", "id": 664674}, {"description": "NFL", "id": 9572, "league": {"abbreviation": "NFL", "description": "NFL", "id": 28}, "leagueId": 28, "sportId": 28}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], "cerebroId": "68f23870c9546c6cde33f371", "contributingPartner": "wsc", "contributingSystem": "wsc", "dataSourceIdentifier": "c40e4c738a2d0", "description": "The \"Get Up\" crew discusses why the Giants' Week 7 matchup vs. the Broncos is pivotal for the team.", "duration": 100, "gameId": 401772757, "headline": "Schrager: This is the biggest game for the Giants since 2022", "id": 46625101, "originalPublishDate": "2025-10-17T12:37:03Z", "pccId": "b5074e02-8ea8-450f-aba8-079dc83b4cd1", "posterImages": {"default": {"height": 324, "width": 576}, "full": {}, "square": {}, "vertical": {}, "verticalFirstFrame": {}, "wide": {}}, "source": "espn", "syndicatable": true, "timeRestrictions": {"embargoDate": "2025-10-17T12:37:03Z", "expirationDate": "2025-10-19T20:05:00Z"}, "title": "Schrager: This is the biggest game for the Giants since 2022", "videoRatio": "16:9,9:16"}]}, "format": {"overtime": {"clock": 600.0, "displayName": "sudden-death", "periods": 1, "slug": "sudden-death"}, "regulation": {"clock": 900.0, "displayName": "Quarter", "periods": 4, "slug": "quarter"}}, "gameInfo": {"venue": {"address": {"city": "Denver", "country": "USA", "state": "CO", "zipCode": "80204"}, "fullName": "Empower Field at Mile High", "grass": true, "id": "3937"}, "weather": {"conditionId": "6", "gust": 14, "highTemperature": 76, "lowTemperature": 76, "precipitation": 0, "temperature": 76}}, "injuries": [{"injuries": [{"athlete": {"collegeAthlete": {}, "displayName": "Jonah Elliss", "fullName": "Jonah Elliss", "id": "4687592", "jersey": "52", "lastName": "Elliss", "position": {"abbreviation": "LB", "displayName": "Linebacker", "name": "Linebacker"}, "shortName": "J.
