You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **boxscore.teams[].statistics**: Basic per-game averages from ESPN

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2024/2025 NFL SEASON

NFL odds: Jaguars by 1. Against the spread: Seahawks 3-2; Jaguars 4-1. Series record: Seahawks lead 6-3. Last meeting: Seahawks beat Jaguars 31-7 on Oct. 31, 2021, in Seattle. Last week: Seahawks beat the Cardinals 23-20; Jaguars beat the Chiefs 31-28. Seahawks offense: overall (9), rush (19), pass (5), scoring (5). Seahawks defense: overall (16), rush (3), pass (25), scoring (13t). Jaguars offense: overall (15), rush (5), pass (17), scoring (10). Jaguars defense: overall (23), rush (11), pass (27), scoring (8). Turnover differential: Seahawks minus-1; Jaguars plus-8. <hl2>Seahawks player to watch</hl2> WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977187/cooper-kupp\">Cooper Kupp</a>. The veteran wideout was targeted a season-high nine times Sunday and caught his second-most passes of the season in a losing effort. While <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430878/jaxon-smith-njigba\">Jaxon Smith-Njigba</a> remains the team's No. 1 receiver, Kupp looks like more than a serviceable option in Seattle\u2019s offense. <hl2>Jaguars player to watch</hl2> CB Greg Newsome. The Jaguars traded fellow cornerback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4379397/tyson-campbell\">Tyson Campbell</a> to Cleveland on Wednesday in exchange for Newsome and expect him to play despite getting in only one practice and a walkthrough. Newsome is in the final year of his rookie contract and could be a long-term solution in Jacksonville. <hl2>Key matchup</hl2> Seattle's run defense ranks among the best in the league and could be challenged by Jacksonville's ground game that has been efficient. Travis Etienne has rushed for 443 yards this season, good for fourth in the NFL. Seattle, meanwhile, has yet to allow an opposing running back to top 100 yards this season. <hl2>Key injuries</hl2> Seahawks: OT <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051716/josh-jones\">Josh Jones</a> (ankle) and LB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4567226/derick-hall\">Derick Hall</a> (oblique) were ruled out.

Jaguars: C <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242391/robert-hainsey\">Robert Hainsey</a> (hamstring) is expected to miss the game, forcing rookie <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430481/jonah-monheim\">Jonah Monheim</a> into the starting lineup. Monheim played well in 17 snaps last week. DE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426349/travon-walker\">Travon Walker</a> (wrist) is wearing a cast and will try to play. <hl2>Series notes</hl2> The Seahawks have won three of the last four against the Jaguars, but all of those came in Seattle. Jacksonville has won back-to-back games at home and is 3-2 in the series at EverBank Stadium. Seattle has outscored Jacksonville by 87 points in the last four meetings. <hl2>Stats and stuff</hl2> The Seahawks are trying to start 4-2 for the second time in three years.

He set career highs with seven catches for 53 yards and two touchdowns last week. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\">https://apnews.com/hub/nfl</a>", "isLiveBlog": false, "allowSearch": true, "allowContentReactions": false}, "wallclockAvailable": false, "ticketsInfo": {"seatSituation": {"opponentTeamName": "Seahawks", "currentTeamName": "Jaguars", "venueName": "EverBank Stadium", "summary": "Tickets as low as $71", "date": "2025-10-12T17:00Z", "dateDay": "Sun", "homeAway": "home", "eventLink": "https://www.vividseats.com/jacksonville-jaguars-tickets-everbank-stadium-3-8-2026--sports-nfl-football/production/5472007?wsUser=717", "venueLink": "https://www.vividseats.com/tiaa-bank-field-tickets/venue/47?wsUser=717", "genericLink": "https://www.vividseats.com/?wsUser=717", "teamLink": "https://www.vividseats.com/jacksonville-jaguars-tickets--sports-nfl-football/performer/381?wsUser=717"}}, "betting_lines": {"spread": 1.5, "over_under": 47.5, "provider": "ESPN BET", "favorite": "SEA"}, "espn_predictor": {"home_win_prob": 49.667, "matchup_quality": 56.584, "predicted_point_diff": -0.037, "away_win_prob": 49.934}, "team_season_stats": {"SEA": {"wins": 3, "losses": 2, "ties": 0, "win_pct": 0.6, "conf_record": "2-2", "div_record": "1-1", "road_record": "2-0", "playoff_seed": 6, "clincher": null, "streak_display": "L1", "points_per_game": 29.2, "points_against_per_game": 21.0, "point_diff": 41, "third_down_pct": 43.63636363636363, "third_down_pct_against": 42.85714285714285, "fourth_down_pct": 50.0, "fourth_down_pct_against": 57.14285714285714, "red_zone_pct": 72.22222222222221, "red_zone_pct_against": 47.368421052631575, "completion_pct": 72.99270072992701, "yards_per_attempt": 9.204379562043796, "passer_rating": 0, "passing_yards": 1261, "passing_tds": 9, "interceptions": 3, "sacks_taken": 6, "rushing_yards": 565, "rushing_tds": 6, "yards_per_carry": 3.9510489510489513, "receiving_yards": 1261, "receiving_tds": 9, "receiving_first_downs": 60, "targets": 130, "receptions": 100, "receiving_yards_after_catch": 457, "def_sacks": 13.0, "def_tackles_solo": 209, "def_tackles_for_loss": 24, "def_interceptions": 7, "def_fumbles_forced": 0, "def_pass_defended": 26, "def_qb_hits": 33, "def_tds": 0, "def_safeties": 0, "fumble_recovery_own": 1, "fumble_recovery_opp": 0, "fumble_recovery_tds": 0, "penalty_yards": 240, "penalties": 27, "fg_made": 9, "fg_att": 12, "fg_pct": 3.25, "fg_long": 210.0, "pat_made": 17, "pat_att": 17, "pat_pct": 5.0, "punt_returns": 8, "punt_return_yards": 166, "kickoff_returns": 20, "kickoff_return_yards": 583, "special_teams_tds": 2, "total_yards": 1826, "yards_per_game": 365.2, "total_first_downs": 96, "first_downs_per_game": 19.2, "total_turnovers": 7, "turnover_margin": 0, "total_epa": 27.8730236645504, "passing_epa": 45.431524802114254, "rushing_epa": -17.55850113756385, "receiving_epa": 57.53883174441451}, "JAX": {"wins": 4, "losses": 1, "ties": 0, "win_pct": 0.8, "conf_record": "2-1", "div_record": "1-0", "road_record": "1-1", "playoff_seed": 5, "clincher": null, "streak_display": "W3", "points_per_game": 25.4, "points_against_per_game": 20.0, "point_diff": 27, "third_down_pct": 39.34426229508197, "third_down_pct_against": 48.48484848484848, "fourth_down_pct": 50.0, "fourth_down_pct_against": 40.0, "red_zone_pct": 55.00000000000001, "red_zone_pct_against": 57.14285714285714, "completion_pct": 60.35502958579882, "yards_per_attempt": 6.307692307692308, "passer_rating": 0, "passing_yards": 1066, "passing_tds": 6, "interceptions": 5, "sacks_taken": 6, "rushing_yards": 685, "rushing_tds": 6, "yards_per_carry": 4.858156028368795, "receiving_yards": 1066, "receiving_tds": 6, "receiving_first_downs": 50, "targets": 163, "receptions": 102, "receiving_yards_after_catch": 514, "def_sacks": 7.0, "def_tackles_solo": 176, "def_tackles_for_loss": 16, "def_interceptions": 10, "def_fumbles_forced": 5, "def_pass_defended": 37, "def_qb_hits": 27, "def_tds": 1, "def_safeties": 0, "fumble_recovery_own": 2, "fumble_recovery_opp": 4, "fumble_recovery_tds": 0, "penalty_yards": 333, "penalties": 42, "fg_made": 10, "fg_att": 12, "fg_pct": 4.166666666666666, "fg_long": 224.0, "pat_made": 13, "pat_att": 13, "pat_pct": 5.0, "punt_returns": 7, "punt_return_yards": 129, "kickoff_returns": 16, "kickoff_return_yards": 401, "special_teams_tds": 1, "total_yards": 1751, "yards_per_game": 350.2, "total_first_downs": 91, "first_downs_per_game": 18.2, "total_turnovers": 6, "turnover_margin": 8, "total_epa": 8.442947508109674, "passing_epa": 1.560520163349776, "rushing_epa": 6.882427344759897, "receiving_epa": 9.285333076991616}}}
