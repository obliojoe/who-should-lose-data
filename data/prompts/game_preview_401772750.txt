You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **boxscore.teams[].statistics**: Basic per-game averages from ESPN

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2024/2025 NFL SEASON

In the 2020 NFL draft, the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/mia/miami-dolphins\">Miami Dolphins</a> held the fifth overall pick and faced the franchise-altering decision of choosing between Herbert or Tagovailoa, two highly touted quarterbacks expected to anchor their teams for years to come. Miami chose Tagovailoa, and one pick later, the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers\">Los Angeles Chargers</a> drafted Herbert. Since then, their career paths have been intertwined, with each milestone, setback and standout performance inviting comparison. \u201cHe\u2019s done a phenomenal job within his career this far,\" Tagovailoa said of Herbert. \"I hope he has a long career. I know everyone wants to do the comparisons with all the dudes that were in my draft class, but all you can do is be happy for the guys, where they\u2019re at in their life of football and wish the best for them.\u201d Tagovailoa's Dolphins (1-4) will face Herbert's Chargers (3-2) for the fourth time on Sunday. Both teams are coming off Week 5 losses in which they built and squandered early leads, and each have been beset by injuries. Los Angeles has lost two straight and continues to face issues along its offensive line. The Chargers used four offensive line combinations in last week's loss to the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-commanders\">Washington Commanders</a>, during which Herbert was sacked four times. Herbert acknowledged that pass protection will be critical against Miami's defense. \u201cThey've got a lot of guys on the front seven that are able to get after the passer,\" he said. \u201cSo it's another week of protection and making sure that we're doing everything we can, communicating with the offensive line, just making sure that we're good to go with our tight ends and running backs.\u201d Without <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116406/tyreek-hill\">Tyreek Hill</a>, who will miss the rest of the season <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/dolphins-tyreek-hill-659c7a5731e1f8a86b7a3627a778ab48\">with a knee injury,</a> the Dolphins' offense started strong against against the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers\">Carolina Panthers</a> last week, converting five of eight third downs as Tagovailoa threw for 151 yards and two touchdowns. But that momentum faded after halftime, with Miami going 0 for 5 on third downs and getting outscored 17-7 in the second half. A poor start to the season seemed to compound Sunday's loss, leaving coach Mike McDaniel candid about his frustrations. \u201cBottom line is it\u2019s frustrating because there\u2019s a lot of talking and we need to major in doing,\u201d McDaniel said. \"And I don\u2019t think anybody wants to hear me talk about it as much as I don\u2019t feel like saying it. It doesn\u2019t change the steadfast reality that is you have to get better at things or you\u2019ll continue having these same results.\u201d <hl2>Addressing penalties</hl2> The Chargers have had a combined 24 penalties for 192 yards in their previous two losses \u2014 a sharp rise from 15 over their first three games of the season. Herbert said minimizing mistakes is always a major point of emphasis, but players who commit pre-snap penalties during practice have been assigned \u201cfocus training,\u201d which includes post-practice sessions with Chargers director of player performance Ben Herbert. \u201cThat's something that coach (Jim Harbaugh) has always done a great job of,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cIf someone does jump or if someone has a pre-snap penalty, they've got focus training after practice. And I think that's just ramped up in making sure that everyone is holding each other accountable.\u201d <hl2>High class</hl2> The 2020 draft class has been lauded as one of the strongest quarterback groups in recent memory. Cincinnati's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow\">Joe Burrow</a> was selected first overall that year and the class also featured Green Bay's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036378/jordan-love\">Jordan Love</a> and Philadelphia's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040715/jalen-hurts\">Jalen Hurts</a>. Together, they've accounted for two Super Bowl appearances \u2014 two by Hurts and one by Burrow \u2014 six Pro Bowl selections and all of them have inked major contract extensions with their respective teams. Tagovailoa, whose success has often been measure against his peers, said he tries not to get caught up in the comparisons. \u201cThe only perspective you have is what you can do to help your team win every week,\u201d he said. \"I wouldn\u2019t say I categorize myself as if I played well, I want to see how I stacked up against this person or not. That\u2019s not how I go about it. I\u2019ve got to do my job and my job is to play well enough to help my team win games.\u201d <hl2>Injury update</hl2> Tagovailoa appeared on the injury report after practice Wednesday with a thumb and hip issue, though offensive coordinator <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4927490/frank-smith\">Frank Smith</a> said the team wasn't concerned about his availability. Smith indicated the injuries were minor and caused by normal \u201ccontact\" that comes with playing quarterback. Tagovailoa missed the final two games of last season with a hip injury. \u201cWe're not anticipating any setbacks for him playing on Sunday,\u201d Smith said Thursday. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\">https://apnews.com/hub/nfl</a>", "isLiveBlog": false, "allowSearch": true, "allowContentReactions": false}, "wallclockAvailable": false, "betting_lines": {"spread": 3.5, "over_under": 45.5, "provider": "ESPN BET", "favorite": "LAC"}, "espn_predictor": {"home_win_prob": 38.778, "matchup_quality": 46.981, "predicted_point_diff": -4.023, "away_win_prob": 60.911}, "team_season_stats": {"LAC": {"wins": 3, "losses": 2, "ties": 0, "win_pct": 0.6, "conf_record": "3-0", "div_record": "3-0", "road_record": "1-1", "playoff_seed": 6, "clincher": null, "streak_display": "L2", "points_per_game": 19.6, "points_against_per_game": 19.6, "point_diff": 0, "third_down_pct": 47.05882352941176, "third_down_pct_against": 37.3134328358209, "fourth_down_pct": 60.0, "fourth_down_pct_against": 66.66666666666666, "red_zone_pct": 38.46153846153847, "red_zone_pct_against": 38.88888888888889, "completion_pct": 65.93406593406593, "yards_per_attempt": 6.994505494505495, "passer_rating": 0, "passing_yards": 1273, "passing_tds": 8, "interceptions": 4, "sacks_taken": 17, "rushing_yards": 584, "rushing_tds": 2, "yards_per_carry": 4.907563025210084, "receiving_yards": 1273, "receiving_tds": 8, "receiving_first_downs": 60, "targets": 176, "receptions": 120, "receiving_yards_after_catch": 559, "def_sacks": 14.0, "def_tackles_solo": 182, "def_tackles_for_loss": 28, "def_interceptions": 3, "def_fumbles_forced": 2, "def_pass_defended": 26, "def_qb_hits": 27, "def_tds": 0, "def_safeties": 0, "fumble_recovery_own": 1, "fumble_recovery_opp": 1, "fumble_recovery_tds": 0, "penalty_yards": 299, "penalties": 39, "fg_made": 9, "fg_att": 9, "fg_pct": 5.0, "fg_long": 218.0, "pat_made": 9, "pat_att": 9, "pat_pct": 5.0, "punt_returns": 8, "punt_return_yards": 82, "kickoff_returns": 18, "kickoff_return_yards": 435, "special_teams_tds": 0, "total_yards": 1857, "yards_per_game": 371.4, "total_first_downs": 92, "first_downs_per_game": 18.4, "total_turnovers": 6, "turnover_margin": -2, "total_epa": -3.808615927238456, "passing_epa": -3.326749537417533, "rushing_epa": -0.4818663898209223, "receiving_epa": 21.64343960422479}, "MIA": {"wins": 1, "losses": 4, "ties": 0, "win_pct": 0.2, "conf_record": "1-3", "div_record": "1-2", "road_record": "0-3", "playoff_seed": 13, "clincher": null, "streak_display": "L1", "points_per_game": 21.4, "points_against_per_game": 29.0, "point_diff": -38, "third_down_pct": 46.66666666666666, "third_down_pct_against": 50.0, "fourth_down_pct": 57.14285714285714, "fourth_down_pct_against": 87.5, "red_zone_pct": 76.92307692307693, "red_zone_pct_against": 52.38095238095239, "completion_pct": 70.25316455696202, "yards_per_attempt": 6.582278481012659, "passer_rating": 0, "passing_yards": 1040, "passing_tds": 10, "interceptions": 4, "sacks_taken": 11, "rushing_yards": 411, "rushing_tds": 2, "yards_per_carry": 4.237113402061856, "receiving_yards": 1040, "receiving_tds": 10, "receiving_first_downs": 60, "targets": 155, "receptions": 111, "receiving_yards_after_catch": 507, "def_sacks": 11.0, "def_tackles_solo": 195, "def_tackles_for_loss": 18, "def_interceptions": 1, "def_fumbles_forced": 4, "def_pass_defended": 14, "def_qb_hits": 18, "def_tds": 0, "def_safeties": 0, "fumble_recovery_own": 3, "fumble_recovery_opp": 4, "fumble_recovery_tds": 0, "penalty_yards": 241, "penalties": 34, "fg_made": 5, "fg_att": 5, "fg_pct": 3.0, "fg_long": 134.0, "pat_made": 12, "pat_att": 12, "pat_pct": 4.0, "punt_returns": 7, "punt_return_yards": 144, "kickoff_returns": 26, "kickoff_return_yards": 667, "special_teams_tds": 1, "total_yards": 1451, "yards_per_game": 290.2, "total_first_downs": 82, "first_downs_per_game": 16.4, "total_turnovers": 5, "turnover_margin": 0, "total_epa": 12.234110559499186, "passing_epa": 15.800136310543758, "rushing_epa": -3.566025751044572, "receiving_epa": 36.42352970220203}}}
