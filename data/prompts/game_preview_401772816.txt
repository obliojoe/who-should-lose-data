You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_records**: AUTHORITATIVE overall season records (wins-losses-ties) for both teams - USE THIS for team records
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **gameInfo**: Venue, weather conditions
- **team_profiles/head_coaches/coordinators**: Coaching context and stadium information for each team
- **injury_report**: Extended injury notes with detailed comments and last-updated timestamps
- **recent_news**: Latest team-specific headlines
- **depth_chart_alerts**: Notable starter/lineup status changes from the latest depth chart snapshot
- **recent_form**: Last five game results for each team
- **event_context**: Broadcast, neutral-site, attendance, and special event notes pulled from the scoreboard feed

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2025/2026 NFL SEASON

Detroit has not dropped consecutive games in the regular season since coach Dan Campbell's second season got off to a shaky start, falling to 1-6 on Oct. 30, 2022. The Lions' 50-game stretch without back-to-back setbacks is the longest in the league since Green Bay went 53 games without consecutive losses from late in the 2018 season through the 2022 season, according to Sportradar, and the next-longest active run is 18 games by the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams\">Los Angeles Rams</a>. \u201cThey\u2019re a resilient group,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThey know how to overcome adversity. They don\u2019t like losing and they go back to work to fix the things that need to be fixed.\u201d If Detroit (4-2) does not address problems it had on both sides of the ball in last week's loss to Kansas City, its remarkable run may end against the NFC-leading <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/tampa-bay-buccaneers\"><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers\">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a></a> (5-1) on Monday night at home. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our hands full,\u201d Campbell said. After the Buccaneers became the first team in NFL history with four wins by three or fewer points in the first five games of season, they <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/49ers-buccaneers-score-4ff79691b71f6d6e563c043b127521d7\">beat San Francisco</a> 30-19 last week. <hl2>Short-handed</hl2> Detroit's banged-up secondary took another hit when the NFL <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lions-chiefs-brian-branch-suspension-8c3121758abd604015dc220a9a884d17\">suspended safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4692025/brian-branch\">Brian Branch</a></a> for punching Chiefs receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster\">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> on Sunday night and setting off a postgame melee. The Lions have five players in their secondary on injured reserve and they held defensive backs <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360383/kerby-joseph\">Kerby Joseph</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4592837/terrion-arnold\">Terrion Arnold</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123938/avonte-maddox\">Avonte Maddox</a> out of practice with injuries on Thursday. Tampa Bay is expecting to be without three of its top receivers, but the position group may get a boost with the return of six-time Pro Bowl receiver <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tampa-bay-buccaneers-mike-evans-919d12693b619f51ec0b2aff21f6fe04\"><a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16737/mike-evans\">Mike Evans</a></a>. He was limited in practice on Thursday after missing three games with a hamstring injury. <hl2>They're No. 1 </hl2> Both quarterbacks, Detroit's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a> and Tampa Bay's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield\">Baker Mayfield</a>, were drafted No. 1 overall by another team that traded them. \"Can recognize that there\u2019s some dark days in that transition and coming out the other side of it for both of us,\u201d Goff said. The Los Angeles Rams kicked off the 2016 draft by taking Goff and after five seasons, including one that ended at the Super Bowl, they dealt him in a blockbuster deal for <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12483/matthew-stafford\">Matthew Stafford</a>. Cleveland selected Mayfield first overall in 2018 and traded him four years later to Carolina. The Panthers released him later that year and he finished the 2022 season with the Rams. The Bucs gave him another chance by signing him in 2023 and he has made the most of the opportunity, reviving his career. \u201cBoth of them have overcome a lot,\u201d Campbell said. <hl2>Rachaad\u2019s role</hl2> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4697815/rachaad-white\">Rachaad White</a> went from being Tampa Bay's primary back to splitting time with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4596448/bucky-irving\">Bucky Irving</a> last season. With Irving out the past two games, White has 157 scrimmage yards and three rushing touchdowns. \u201cRachaad made some really, really good plays,\u201d Mayfield said. <hl2>Return of the mack</hl2> <hl2 /> Detroit defensive tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361662/alim-mcneill\">Alim McNeill</a>, who signed a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/detroit-lions-alim-mcneill-contract-5e21c36d5c00011202989b9e4fce5c90\">$97 million contract extension</a> a year ago, is expected to play for the first time since tearing the ACL in his right knee late last season. \u201cIt's going to be a big day, a big deal, in the back of my head,\u201d he said. <hl2>Sack attack</hl2> The Buccaneers had 10 sacks in the first five games before registering six against <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241464/mac-jones\">Mac Jones</a> in a win over the 49ers last week. They recorded a sack on 15.4% of dropbacks. Even more impressive, Tampa Bay didn\u2019t have to blitz much to get pressure. \u201cIt all starts up front for us,\u201d Bucs coach Todd Bowles said. \u201cIf we can get off the ball and you don\u2019t have to blitz and you can go with four (rushers) and they work together, we\u2019re a pretty good defense.\u201d Linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4686334/yaya-diaby\">Yaya Diaby</a> had two sacks on Jones and leads the team with three. Veteran linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14985/lavonte-david\">Lavonte David</a> and nose tackle <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3134362/vita-vea\">Vita Vea</a> each have 2 1/2. Vea had five quarterback pressures while facing double-teams on 69.7% of dropbacks. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\">https://apnews.com/hub/nfl</a>", "title": "Lions host Bucs on Monday night, hoping to extend league's longest streak without consecutive losses", "video": []}, "format": {"overtime": {"clock": 600.0, "displayName": "sudden-death", "periods": 1, "slug": "sudden-death"}, "regulation": {"clock": 900.0, "displayName": "Quarter", "periods": 4, "slug": "quarter"}}, "gameInfo": {"venue": {"address": {"city": "Detroit", "country": "USA", "state": "MI", "zipCode": "48226"}, "fullName": "Ford Field", "grass": false, "id": "3727"}, "weather": {"conditionId": "34", "gust": 15, "highTemperature": 56, "lowTemperature": 56, "precipitation": 0, "temperature": 56}}, "injuries": [{"injuries": [{"athlete": {"collegeAthlete": {}, "displayName": "Terrion Arnold", "fullName": "Terrion Arnold", "id": "4592837", "jersey": "6", "lastName": "Arnold", "position": {"abbreviation": "CB", "displayName": "Cornerback", "name": "Cornerback"}, "shortName": "T.
