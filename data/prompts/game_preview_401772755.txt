You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_records**: AUTHORITATIVE overall season records (wins-losses-ties) for both teams - USE THIS for team records
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **gameInfo**: Venue, weather conditions
- **team_profiles/head_coaches/coordinators**: Coaching context and stadium information for each team
- **injury_report**: Extended injury notes with detailed comments and last-updated timestamps
- **recent_news**: Latest team-specific headlines
- **depth_chart_alerts**: Notable starter/lineup status changes from the latest depth chart snapshot
- **recent_form**: Last five game results for each team
- **event_context**: Broadcast, neutral-site, attendance, and special event notes pulled from the scoreboard feed

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2025/2026 NFL SEASON

Against the spread: Patriots 4-2, Titans 2-4. Series record: Patriots lead 26-19-1. Last meeting: Titans beat the Patriots 20-17 in OT on Nov. 3, 2024, in Nashville. Last week: Patriots beat Saints 25-19, Titans lost at Raiders 20-10. Patriots offense: overall (16), rush (26), pass (6), scoring (11).

Turnover differential: Patriots even; Titans minus-1. <hl2>Patriots player to watch</hl2> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4431452/drake-maye\">Drake Maye</a>. The second-year quarterback is thriving in offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels' system. Maye tied a career high with three touchdown passes last week at New Orleans. He has also had five straight games with a 100-plus passer rating after finishing with a 140.1 rating against the Saints. He enters this week second in the NFL with a 73.2 completion rate. Detroit's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff\">Jared Goff</a> is leading the league at 75.9. <hl2>Titans player to watch</hl2> <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4688380/cam-ward\">Cam Ward</a>. The No. 1 overall pick in the April draft is a big reason why the Titans fired Brian Callahan on Monday, wanting to see improvement out of the offense. Ward completed a career-high 26 passes last week for 222 yards. The rookie has more interceptions (four) than TD passes (3). <hl2>Key matchup</hl2> The Patriots pass defense against the rookie quarterback. New England is giving up 239 yards per game through the air and ranks last in the NFL in allowing 7.88 yards per pass play. Ward has shown a knack for throwing deep. <hl2>Key injuries</hl2> Patriots: WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976212/stefon-diggs\">Stefon Diggs</a> (chest) and LBs Harold Landry (ankle) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3925350/anfernee-jennings\">Anfernee Jennings</a> (ankle) practiced fully Friday and are questionable. S <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3858276/jaylinn-hawkins\">Jaylinn Hawkins</a> (hamstring) was limited Thursday and Friday. He's questionable along with CB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4368113/charles-woods\">Charles Woods</a> (knee), who missed two practices. Titans: K <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3124084/joey-slye\">Joey Slye</a> (right calf) is available after being limited all week after missing the last game.

LB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915525/dre'mont-jones\">Dre'Mont Jones</a> (knee) is questionable after being added to the injury report Thursday. DT <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428617/t'vondre-sweat\">T'Vondre Sweat</a> (ankle) practiced all week and may be activated from injured reserve. <hl2>Series notes</hl2> This will be the first game Patriots coach Mike Vrabel will coach against the franchise that gave him his first head coaching job in 2018. Vrabel coached the Titans to their most recent playoff win in this series, a wild-card victory that was the last for Tom Brady in a Patriots' uniform. These are two of the original AFL franchises, and this will be the second straight season the Patriots have visited the Titans. The Titans have won three of the past four games between these teams. That includes last season in the most recent game the Titans have won at Nissan Stadium. Mike McCoy will make his debut as the Titans' interim head coach after Brian Callahan was fired Monday. <hl2>Stats and stuff</hl2> The Patriots have won three straight games.
