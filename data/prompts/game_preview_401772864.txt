You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_records**: AUTHORITATIVE overall season records (wins-losses-ties) for both teams - USE THIS for team records
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **gameInfo**: Venue, weather conditions
- **team_profiles/head_coaches/coordinators**: Coaching context and stadium information for each team
- **injury_report**: Extended injury notes with detailed comments and last-updated timestamps
- **recent_news**: Latest team-specific headlines
- **depth_chart_alerts**: Notable starter/lineup status changes from the latest depth chart snapshot
- **recent_form**: Last five game results for each team
- **event_context**: Broadcast, neutral-site, attendance, and special event notes pulled from the scoreboard feed

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2025/2026 NFL SEASON

Turnover differential: Commanders minus-3, Cowboys minus-2. <hl2>Commanders player to watch</hl2> WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426948/luke-mccaffrey\">Luke McCaffrey</a>. After playing in his first 19 NFL games without a touchdown, the younger brother of 49ers star <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3117251/christian-mccaffrey\">Christian McCaffrey</a> has scored in three of the past four games. That includes a 33-yard TD catch in Week 6 \u2014 his only reception of the game. The third-round draft pick out of Rice in 2024 is averaging 31.5 yards on kickoff returns, the highest rate for anyone in the league with at least 10 runbacks. <hl2>Cowboys player to watch</hl2> QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577417/dak-prescott\">Dak Prescott</a> missed both Washington meetings last season after tearing a hamstring eight games in. He has found the form of 2023, when he was runner-up in MVP voting and beat the Commanders twice to improve to 11-2 against them in his career. Prescott has thrown at least three touchdown passes without an interception in three consecutive games. A fourth in a row would put him in the company of Tom Brady, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8439/aaron-rodgers\">Aaron Rodgers</a>, Peyton Manning, Drew Brees and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14881/russell-wilson\">Russell Wilson</a> as the only quarterbacks to do that. He leads the NFL in completions (164) and is second in yards (1,617) and TDs passing (13). <hl2>Key matchup</hl2> The defenses won't be on the field at the same time, but which struggling unit will get enough done to win the game? Dallas is 32nd in total defense, Washington is 26th. On paper, the Commanders have the edge because they're a respectable 13th in scoring defense. The Cowboys are 31st in scoring, allowing 30.7 points per game. Both teams are having coverage issues in the secondary, which is good news for Prescott and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426348/jayden-daniels\">Jayden Daniels</a>. <hl2>Key injuries</hl2> Commanders: WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121422/terry-mclaurin\">Terry McLaurin</a>, Daniels\u2019 favorite and best option, will miss a fourth consecutive game with a quadriceps injury. ... WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121409/noah-brown\">Noah Brown</a>, another starter, was placed on injured reserve with knee and groin injuries, sidelining him at least another four games after he missed four already. .. RG <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4262199/sam-cosmi\">Sam Cosmi</a> has been out all season after tearing a knee ligament in the playoffs, but his 21-day practice window is open. He appears set to return against Dallas. ... DE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3928979/dorance-armstrong\">Dorance Armstrong</a>, who spent his first six seasons with the Cowboys, is nursing a hamstring injury. He's fifth in the NFL with 5 1/2 sacks. Cowboys: WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241389/ceedee-lamb\">CeeDee Lamb</a>, rookie RG <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685263/tyler-booker\">Tyler Booker</a> and WR/KR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3676833/kavontae-turpin\">KaVontae Turpin</a> are trending toward returning after missing multiple weeks. Lamb and Booker have been out three weeks with high ankle sprains, and Turpin has a foot injury that sidelined him the past two games. ... CB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040966/trevon-diggs\">Trevon Diggs</a> is out after sustaining a concussion in an accident at home Thursday night. <hl2>Series notes</hl2> Daniels didn't beat Dallas during his dynamic rookie season in 2024. He threw two touchdowns and two interceptions in a 34-26 loss at home last November when the teams combined to score five touchdowns in the last five minutes. Daniels was watching when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576980/marcus-mariota\">Marcus Mariota</a> led the winning drive in a mostly meaningless regular-season finale last season. The Commanders were only playing for seeding after qualifying for the playoffs. Daniels didn't play in the second half. <hl2>Stats and stuff</hl2> The Commanders have alternated wins and losses so far this season. \u2026 In each of Daniels\u2019 four games \u2014 he missed two with an injured left knee \u2014 he has at least 200 yards passing and at least one TD pass, the first Washington quarterback to start a season that way since <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14880/kirk-cousins\">Kirk Cousins</a> in 2014. \u2026 LB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13976/von-miller\">Von Miller</a> is up to 133 sacks, moving him ahead of Lawrence Taylor and into 14th place since the NFL began officially recording the statistic in 1982. \u2026 LB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14979/bobby-wagner\">Bobby Wagner</a> is second in the NFL with 65 tackles. \u2026 Washington has just three takeaways this season; only two clubs have produced fewer. \u2026 The Commanders had three turnovers against the Bears, equaling their total from the season\u2019s first five games. Daniels was responsible for two, an early interception and a late fumble on a botched handoff to RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4575131/jacory-croskey-merritt\">Jacory Croskey-Merritt</a>. The rookie seventh-round draft pick also lost his own fumble in that game, his second week in a row with a fumble. \u2026 Prescott is one game shy of Tony Romo's club record of 67 games with a passer rating of at least 100. ... RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361579/javonte-williams\">Javonte Williams</a> is tied for third in the NFL with five touchdowns rushing and fourth with 476 yards rushing. ... TE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242355/jake-ferguson\">Jake Ferguson</a> has a touchdown catch in three consecutive games. Jason Witten, the club's career leader in catches and yards receiving, is the only Dallas tight end with a longer TD streak. It was five in 2010. ... If Lamb returns, he needs 51 scrimmage yards to be the fastest to 7,000 in club history. ... CB Trevon Diggs has an interception in his past two home games. <hl2>Fantasy tip</hl2> Cowboys WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426354/george-pickens\">George Pickens</a> has a five-game touchdown streak, with six total in that span. It's already a career high. He has thrived in the three games Lamb has been sidelined, so the question will be how many targets he gets if Lamb returns. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\">https://apnews.com/hub/nfl</a>", "title": "Jayden Daniels wants a win over Cowboys he can call his own as Commanders try to bounce back", "video": []}, "format": {"overtime": {"clock": 600.0, "displayName": "sudden-death", "periods": 1, "slug": "sudden-death"}, "regulation": {"clock": 900.0, "displayName": "Quarter", "periods": 4, "slug": "quarter"}}, "gameInfo": {"venue": {"address": {"city": "Arlington", "country": "USA", "state": "TX", "zipCode": "76011"}, "fullName": "AT&T Stadium", "grass": false, "id": "3687"}, "weather": {"conditionId": "1", "gust": 9, "highTemperature": 75, "lowTemperature": 75, "precipitation": 0, "temperature": 75}}, "injuries": [{"injuries": [{"athlete": {"collegeAthlete": {}, "displayName": "Trevor Keegan", "fullName": "Trevor Keegan", "id": "4427140", "jersey": "76", "lastName": "Keegan", "position": {"abbreviation": "G", "displayName": "Guard", "name": "Guard"}, "shortName": "T.
