=== END LEAGUE CONTEXT ===

IMPORTANT: For the league_pulse.summary field, use markdown formatting (bold for team names, italics for emphasis) to make it more engaging.

Generate:
1. league_pulse.summary - 3-6 engaging sentences with markdown formatting about the league's current state
   IMPORTANT: Focus on narrative and storylines, NOT raw statistics. Tell a compelling story about what's happening in the league. Minimize numbers - they're shown elsewhere on the page.
2. league_pulse.key_storylines - Array of 3 storylines, each with:
   - title: Catchy 3-6 word headline
   - description: 2-3 sentences focusing on narrative over numbers. Use stats sparingly and only when essential to the story.
3. game_of_the_week.tagline - 1-2 sentences about DET @ KC
   NOTE: This game may have already been played. Status: completed
   - If status is "completed": Write a brief recap highlighting what made it the best game
   - If status is "upcoming": Explain why it's THE game to watch
   Use LEAGUE CONTEXT to find team data. Do NOT reference past seasons, Super Bowls, or historical matchups.
4. game_of_the_meek.tagline - 1-2 sentences about TEN @ LV
   NOTE: This game may have already been played. Status: completed
   - If status is "completed": Write a humorous recap of why it was forgettable
   - If status is "upcoming": Explain humorously why it's skippable
5. stat_leader_contexts - For each of the three stat categories above (OFFENSE STATS, DEFENSE STATS, EFFICIENCY STATS), provide exactly 5 brief context phrases (2-6 words each).
   IMPORTANT: You must provide contexts for ALL THREE categories: offense, defense, AND efficiency.
   Return format: {"offense": ["phrase1", "phrase2", "phrase3", "phrase4", "phrase5"], "defense": ["phrase1", "phrase2", "phrase3", "phrase4", "phrase5"], "efficiency": ["phrase1", "phrase2", "phrase3", "phrase4", "phrase5"]}

6. individual_contexts - For the 6 individual stat leaders shown in LEAGUE CONTEXT, provide context explaining why their performance matters (PLAIN STRING, not object).
   Return format: ["string1", "string2", "string3", "string4", "string5", "string6"]
   IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on their current season performance and stats. Do NOT make assumptions about career length, years in the league, or draft status.

7. power_rankings reasons - Provide 1-sentence reasons for biggest_riser and biggest_faller:
   Riser: IND
   Faller: CIN

8. playoff_key_infos - For the 12 teams shown in PLAYOFF PICTURE in LEAGUE CONTEXT (4 top, 4 middle, 4 bottom), provide brief context (PLAIN STRING, not object).
   Return format: {"top_4": ["string1", "string2", "string3", "string4"], "middle_4": ["string1", ...], "bottom_4": ["string1", ...]}

9. week_preview taglines - Brief 5-8 word taglines for Thursday night and 2 Sunday games

IMPORTANT: All context fields must be PLAIN STRINGS in arrays, not nested objects. Do not include team names, stats, or other data - ONLY the creative text.
