You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_records**: AUTHORITATIVE overall season records (wins-losses-ties) for both teams - USE THIS for team records
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **gameInfo**: Venue, weather conditions
- **team_profiles/head_coaches/coordinators**: Coaching context and stadium information for each team
- **injury_report**: Extended injury notes with detailed comments and last-updated timestamps
- **recent_news**: Latest team-specific headlines
- **depth_chart_alerts**: Notable starter/lineup status changes from the latest depth chart snapshot
- **recent_form**: Last five game results for each team
- **event_context**: Broadcast, neutral-site, attendance, and special event notes pulled from the scoreboard feed

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2025/2026 NFL SEASON

NFL Odds: Chiefs by 12. Against the spread: Raiders 2-4; Chiefs 3-3. Series record: Chiefs lead 75-55-2. Last meeting: Chiefs beat Raiders 19-17 on Nov. 29, 2024, at Kansas City.

Tracking down Chiefs QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes\">Patrick Mahomes</a> is a whole different challenge, but it\u2019s one that Crosby seems to savor, a feeling that is mutual based on what both players have said. It certainly is a delight for fans to watch the two go at it. <hl2>Chiefs player to watch</hl2> WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4428331/rashee-rice\">Rashee Rice</a> comes back from his six-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy when he caused a high-speed crash on a Dallas highway in March 2024. He is also playing for the first time since tearing his ACL four games into last season, when Mahomes collided with him while trying to make a tackle following an interception. <hl2>Key matchup</hl2> The Chiefs wide receivers against the Las Vegas pass defense. Mahomes has been playing at an MVP-caliber level ever since getting <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4683062/xavier-worthy\">Xavier Worthy</a> back from a shoulder injury that he sustained in a Week 1 loss to the Chargers. Now, he has Rice joining a mix that also includes Marquise Brown and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3120348/juju-smith-schuster\">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a>. <hl2>Key injuries</hl2> Raiders TE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4432665/brock-bowers\">Brock Bowers</a> (knee) is doubtful and WRs <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916433/jakobi-meyers\">Jakobi Meyers</a> (knee and toe) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3919510/alex-bachman\">Alex Bachman</a> (ankle) are questionable. Chiefs LT <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569659/josh-simmons\">Josh Simmons</a> has been ruled out for personal reasons. <hl2>Series notes</hl2> The Chiefs have won nine of the past 10 matchups and 14 of the past 16 going back to the 2017 season. The most recent Raiders win was at Arrowhead Stadium on Christmas Day in 2023, which turned out to be the last time Kansas City lost that season. It won its last two regular-season games, then four playoff games, including the Super Bowl against San Francisco. <hl2>Stats and stuff</hl2> Raiders RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4890973/ashton-jeanty\">Ashton Jeanty</a> has forced 34 missed tackles, according to Next Gen Stats, which is second in the league. That has resulted in 193 yards rushing, the third most. \u2026 The Raiders\u2019 37 tackles for loss are one behind leader Tampa Bay. \u2026 Las Vegas\u2019 10 passes defended by defensive linemen is easily the most. Indianapolis and New Orleans are next at six apiece. \u2026 The Raiders\u2019 240 yards rushing against Chicago on Sept. 28 is the highest total for an NFL team this season. \u2026 Crosby needs one sack to join Greg Townsend as the only Raiders with at least five sacks in each of his first seven seasons since the statistic has been kept in 1982. \u2026 WR Jakobi Meyers has multiple receptions in 30 consecutive games. \u2026 Bowers has caught at least two passes in his first 21 games, which ties the longest streak for a TE to open a career. Detroit\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4430027/sam-laporta\">Sam LaPorta</a> set the record in 2023-24. ... Las Vegas S <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4043169/jeremy-chinn\">Jeremy Chinn</a> needs one sack to become the eighth defensive back since 1982 with six consecutive seasons with at least one. \u2026 K Daniel Carlson\u2019s 214 made field goals are the second most since he entered the league in 2018. He is one behind <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15683/justin-tucker\">Justin Tucker</a>. ... Mahomes is 12-2 against the Raiders with 33 TD passes in those games. ... Chiefs TE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15847/travis-kelce\">Travis Kelce</a> needs two TDs to tie Priest Holmes (83) for most in franchise history. Kelce has a catch in an NFL-leading 180 straight games. ... Chiefs RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361529/isiah-pacheco\">Isiah Pacheco</a> has four TD runs in his past four games against Las Vegas. ... Brown had two TD catches for Kansas City last week against Detroit. ... Chiefs DE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3929865/charles-omenihu\">Charles Omenihu</a> has a sack in back-to-back games. <hl2>Fantasy tip</hl2> As tempting as it might for Rice owners to put him into the starting lineup after waiting for six weeks, it might be worth waiting one more. The Chiefs are likely to ease him back into the mix, perhaps giving him 30 or so snaps against Las Vegas. With their passing attack already humming, there is no need to rush him back into full-time duty. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\">https://apnews.com/hub/nfl</a>", "title": "Raiders visit Chiefs for another matchup between longtime AFC West rivals", "video": []}, "format": {"overtime": {"clock": 600.0, "displayName": "sudden-death", "periods": 1, "slug": "sudden-death"}, "regulation": {"clock": 900.0, "displayName": "Quarter", "periods": 4, "slug": "quarter"}}, "gameInfo": {"venue": {"address": {"city": "Kansas City", "country": "USA", "state": "MO", "zipCode": "64129"}, "fullName": "GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium", "grass": true, "id": "3622"}, "weather": {"conditionId": "1", "gust": 22, "highTemperature": 59, "lowTemperature": 59, "precipitation": 0, "temperature": 59}}, "injuries": [{"injuries": [{"athlete": {"collegeAthlete": {}, "displayName": "Josh Simmons", "fullName": "Josh Simmons", "id": "4569659", "jersey": "71", "lastName": "Simmons", "position": {"abbreviation": "OT", "displayName": "Offensive Tackle", "name": "Offensive Tackle"}, "shortName": "J.
