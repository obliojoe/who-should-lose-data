You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_records**: AUTHORITATIVE overall season records (wins-losses-ties) for both teams - USE THIS for team records
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **gameInfo**: Venue, weather conditions

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2025/2026 NFL SEASON

WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040655/darnell-mooney\">Darnell Mooney</a> has been ruled out with a hamstring injury. <hl2>Series notes</hl2> The series began with the Bills beating the Falcons in Atlanta in 1973 and included the non-conference teams meeting in Toronto on Dec. 1, 2013. The Bills lost their \u201chome\u201d game 34-31 in overtime at Toronto's domed Rogers Centre in what became the final outing of Buffalo's six-year \u201cBills in Toronto Series.\" Terry and Kim Pegula canceled the series a year later upon purchasing the Bills. The Falcons won four straight home games before a 23-17 loss in 2017 in the teams' last meeting at Atlanta. <hl2>Stats and stuff</hl2> The Bills are 22-6 following a regular-season loss dating to the start of the 2019 season. And they're 10-2 when playing a road game following a loss. ... With two TD passes last week, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17102/josh-allen\">Josh Allen</a> now has 68 career games with multiple touchdown throws, breaking the franchise record set by Hall of Famer Jim Kelly. ... Allen has committed three turnovers (two interceptions and a lost fumble) in his past two outings after throwing one interception in his previous 12 starts, including playoffs. Allen is 45-28 when committing a turnover and 15-20 when turning over the ball in the second half. ... Since 2019, the Bills are 7-6 when committing three turnovers in an outing. ... RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4379399/james-cook\">James Cook</a> was held to a season-low 49 yards from scrimmage (all rushing) after topping 100 in each of his first four outings.

Penix set career highs by completing 76.9% of his passes and passing for 313 yards in the win over Washington. ... Watts leads NFL rookies with two interceptions. ... The Falcons have allowed only five sacks, the second-fewest in the NFL. Indianapolis has given up only four sacks. <hl2>Fantasy tip</hl2> <hl2 /> While WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426502/drake-london\">Drake London</a> is Penix's top target, TE Kyle Pitts had his first TD catch of the year against Washington and is looking for his fifth straight game with at least four catches. Pitts has been a risky fantasy play in recent years but is becoming a more trustworthy option with Penix at quarterback. His 70 yards receiving in Week 4 tied for the league high by a tight end. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\">https://apnews.com/hub/nfl</a>", "isLiveBlog": false, "allowSearch": true, "allowContentReactions": false}, "betting_lines": {"spread": 3.5, "over_under": 49.5, "provider": "ESPN BET", "favorite": "BUF"}, "espn_predictor": {"home_win_prob": 38.91, "matchup_quality": 59.916, "predicted_point_diff": -4.167, "away_win_prob": 60.777}, "team_season_stats": {"BUF": {"wins": 4, "losses": 1, "ties": 0, "win_pct": 0.8, "conf_record": "3-1", "div_record": "2-1", "road_record": "1-0", "playoff_seed": 3, "clincher": null, "points_per_game": 30.6, "points_against_per_game": 22.6, "point_diff": 40, "third_down_pct": 46.42857142857143, "third_down_pct_against": 40.67796610169492, "fourth_down_pct": 75.0, "fourth_down_pct_against": 66.66666666666666, "red_zone_pct": 63.63636363636363, "red_zone_pct_against": 60.0, "completion_pct": 70.12987012987013, "yards_per_attempt": 8.11038961038961, "passer_rating": 0, "passing_yards": 1249, "passing_tds": 9, "interceptions": 2, "sacks_taken": 8, "rushing_yards": 772, "rushing_tds": 9, "yards_per_carry": 4.765432098765432, "receiving_yards": 1249, "receiving_tds": 9, "receiving_first_downs": 66, "targets": 149, "receptions": 108, "receiving_yards_after_catch": 635, "def_sacks": 13.0, "def_tackles_solo": 206, "def_tackles_for_loss": 26, "def_interceptions": 2, "def_fumbles_forced": 8, "def_pass_defended": 11, "def_qb_hits": 24, "def_tds": 0, "def_safeties": 0, "fumble_recovery_own": 3, "fumble_recovery_opp": 3, "fumble_recovery_tds": 0, "penalty_yards": 287, "penalties": 36, "fg_made": 10, "fg_att": 11, "fg_pct": 4.5, "fg_long": 223.0, "pat_made": 15, "pat_att": 15, "pat_pct": 5.0, "punt_returns": 8, "punt_return_yards": 43, "kickoff_returns": 21, "kickoff_return_yards": 557, "special_teams_tds": 0, "total_yards": 2021, "yards_per_game": 404.2, "total_first_downs": 112, "first_downs_per_game": 22.4, "total_turnovers": 4, "turnover_margin": 1, "total_epa": 57.229920678139614, "passing_epa": 40.718591143730336, "rushing_epa": 16.511329534409278, "receiving_epa": 49.51540013551055}, "ATL": {"wins": 2, "losses": 2, "ties": 0, "win_pct": 0.5, "conf_record": "2-2", "div_record": "0-2", "road_record": "1-1", "playoff_seed": 11, "clincher": null, "points_per_game": 19.0, "points_against_per_game": 21.5, "point_diff": -10, "third_down_pct": 42.5925925925926, "third_down_pct_against": 34.090909090909086, "fourth_down_pct": 50.0, "fourth_down_pct_against": 85.71428571428571, "red_zone_pct": 46.15384615384615, "red_zone_pct_against": 66.66666666666666, "completion_pct": 62.87878787878788, "yards_per_attempt": 7.174242424242424, "passer_rating": 0, "passing_yards": 947, "passing_tds": 3, "interceptions": 3, "sacks_taken": 5, "rushing_yards": 546, "rushing_tds": 4, "yards_per_carry": 4.299212598425197, "receiving_yards": 947, "receiving_tds": 3, "receiving_first_downs": 46, "targets": 130, "receptions": 83, "receiving_yards_after_catch": 493, "def_sacks": 10.0, "def_tackles_solo": 121, "def_tackles_for_loss": 15, "def_interceptions": 3, "def_fumbles_forced": 3, "def_pass_defended": 16, "def_qb_hits": 23, "def_tds": 0, "def_safeties": 0, "fumble_recovery_own": 3, "fumble_recovery_opp": 3, "fumble_recovery_tds": 0, "penalty_yards": 152, "penalties": 21, "fg_made": 9, "fg_att": 12, "fg_pct": 2.6666666666666665, "fg_long": 133.0, "pat_made": 7, "pat_att": 7, "pat_pct": 3.0, "punt_returns": 5, "punt_return_yards": 29, "kickoff_returns": 16, "kickoff_return_yards": 332, "special_teams_tds": 0, "total_yards": 1493, "yards_per_game": 373.25, "total_first_downs": 79, "first_downs_per_game": 19.75, "total_turnovers": 5, "turnover_margin": 1, "total_epa": -0.930899077346056, "passing_epa": 2.8194660319802267, "rushing_epa": -3.750365109326282, "receiving_epa": 6.802960611239573}}, "team_records": {"BUF": {"wins": 4, "losses": 1, "ties": 0, "record_display": "4-1"}, "ATL": {"wins": 2, "losses": 2, "ties": 0, "record_display": "2-2"}}}
