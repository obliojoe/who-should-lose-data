You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **boxscore.teams[].statistics**: Basic per-game averages from ESPN

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2024/2025 NFL SEASON

After all, their <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/broncos-eagles-score-f7878753735aa61e0e1e0e793276cc0c\">21-17 win over the previously unbeaten <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi/philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia Eagles</a></a> was last week \u2014 and a continent away. \u201cYes, we definitely have to get back honed in, get back focused and move on to the next game,\u201d Broncos outside linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040608/jonathon-cooper\">Jonathon Cooper</a> said as the team prepared to face the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/nyj/new-york-jets\">New York Jets</a> on Sunday in London at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. \u201cYou can\u2019t live on this game and be like, \u2018Wow, we beat the Eagles,\u2019 and then just carry that into the week,\u201d Cooper added. \u201cNo, it\u2019s time to flush that one. Process it, review it, learn from it and then on to the next one.\u201d That would be the struggling Jets (0-5), who are <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jets-glenn-cowboys-7b1efe46b0cc2031537765a10d7a4412\">still looking for their first win</a> under Aaron Glenn. He's the first coach in franchise history to begin his tenure with five losses. A loss to the Broncos (3-2) on Sunday would give them their third 0-6 start and first since they opened 0-13 under Adam Gase in 2020. \u201cListen, we say it\u2019s a long season, but we know how these weeks continue to compile and we have to make sure we get out of this hole that we\u2019re in,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cAnd we all understand that.\u201d The Jets are the only NFL team without a win. They were <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cowboys-jets-score-prescott-e0a42f21afef167aaa24f46d70d953be\">steamrolled by the <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/dal/dallas-cowboys\">Dallas Cowboys</a></a> last Sunday, falling 37-22 in a game that was never close. Glenn has preached patience, but frustrated fans are just about out of that \u2014 especially with the team appearing likely to extend the league's longest active playoff drought to 15 seasons. No team has made the postseason after starting 0-5. Still, Denver quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4426338/bo-nix\">Bo Nix</a> was miffed at the mere suggestion the Broncos could overlook the Jets. \u201cI think in the league, quite honestly, it\u2019s a little disrespectful to consider anybody a trap team,\u201d Nix said. \u201cI think any game you can walk in and slip up and lose, that\u2019s just the league. ... They were a couple of walk-off plays away from having two or three wins. I definitely think that is something you\u2019ve got to be careful with. \u201cThis is not a team to just toss around like they\u2019re winless, but I think we will be ready to go.\u201d <hl2>Consecutive DPOYs?</hl2> Take it from the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year: Denver outside linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360259/nik-bonitto\">Nik Bonitto</a> has what it takes to win the award this season. \u201cHe\u2019s my favorite, I\u2019m not going to lie,\u201d Broncos cornerback Patrick Surtain II said of his teammate, who's tied with the Giants' <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035631/brian-burns\">Brian Burns</a> for the league lead with seven sacks. \u201cShoot, even last year he was up for it. I think this year he\u2019s setting himself apart. I know we\u2019ve got a lot more games down the road, but as long as he stays consistent, stays healthy, for sure ... I think his game has leveled up.\u201d <hl2>Familiar foes</hl2> Glenn spent the final season of his 15-year playing career in New Orleans, where Sean Payton was his head coach in 2008. He returned to the Saints eight years later, serving as Payton's defensive backs coach for five seasons. The two will square off Sunday for the first time as opposing head coaches. \u201cI owe a lot of my coaching development to Sean,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a hell of a coach. ... He\u2019s one of the guys that I love everything about who he is and what he\u2019s about and I\u2019m looking forward to competing against him.\u201d Payton recalled speaking to Glenn for about 20 minutes the night before the former cornerback took the job with Jets in January. The two haven't chatted since, but might have a few moments to catch up before the game. \u201cHe\u2019s a tremendous coach,\" Payton said. \u201cHe was a huge asset to us in New Orleans. I\u2019ve said this before, as a head coach you love to see guys get these opportunities. ... Aaron\u2019s getting things built there.\u201d <hl2>Roll or rut?</hl2> After starting last week with seven punts in eight possessions, the Broncos scored on all three of their fourth-quarter drives with the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/broncos-comeback-nix-surtain-bonitto-payton-d05a817501b7f56086db696000476c15\">18 unanswered points</a> producing the win at Philadelphia. So, is Denver\u2019s offense on a roll or in a rut? \u201cOur defense just continued to make a stop,\u201d Nix said. \u201cWe just kind of had some hope, had some life there at the end of the game, and we just kept chipping away, found things that worked, and eventually put some touchdown drives together. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to win games like that.\u201d <hl2>Tough takeaways</hl2> The Jets' defense is making dubious history this season. They're the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jets-analysis-glenn-8ec57c50dd441af185ee7fffcf967b84\">first NFL team to have no takeaways</a> through the first five games since 1933, when turnovers were first tracked, according to ESPN Research. The only team since 1960 to go six straight at any point without a takeaway was the 2018 <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers\">San Francisco 49ers</a>, according to Sportradar. \u201cIt has to be a conscious thing,\u201d linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361331/jamien-sherwood\">Jamien Sherwood</a> said. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be going in there and making the tackle. You have to go in there with the mindset that I\u2019m going to make the tackle and punch the ball out. When the ball goes up in the air, I\u2019m going to go up and get it. I\u2019m going to be the one to bring the ball down.\" ------ AP Pro Football Writer Arnie Stapleton contributed to this report. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\">https://apnews.com/hub/NFL</a>", "isLiveBlog": false, "allowSearch": true, "allowContentReactions": false}, "wallclockAvailable": false, "betting_lines": {"spread": 6.5, "over_under": 43.5, "provider": "ESPN BET", "favorite": "DEN"}, "espn_predictor": {"home_win_prob": 28.618, "matchup_quality": 43.91, "predicted_point_diff": -8.126, "away_win_prob": 71.152}, "team_season_stats": {"DEN": {"wins": 3, "losses": 2, "ties": 0, "win_pct": 0.6, "conf_record": "2-2", "div_record": "0-1", "road_record": "1-2", "playoff_seed": 7, "clincher": null, "streak_display": "W2", "points_per_game": 23.4, "points_against_per_game": 16.8, "point_diff": 33, "third_down_pct": 37.87878787878788, "third_down_pct_against": 30.303030303030305, "fourth_down_pct": 40.0, "fourth_down_pct_against": 0.0, "red_zone_pct": 66.66666666666666, "red_zone_pct_against": 28.57142857142857, "completion_pct": 64.77272727272727, "yards_per_attempt": 6.267045454545454, "passer_rating": 0, "passing_yards": 1103, "passing_tds": 8, "interceptions": 4, "sacks_taken": 5, "rushing_yards": 703, "rushing_tds": 6, "yards_per_carry": 4.950704225352113, "receiving_yards": 1103, "receiving_tds": 8, "receiving_first_downs": 54, "targets": 168, "receptions": 114, "receiving_yards_after_catch": 648, "def_sacks": 21.0, "def_tackles_solo": 176, "def_tackles_for_loss": 24, "def_interceptions": 1, "def_fumbles_forced": 4, "def_pass_defended": 27, "def_qb_hits": 48, "def_tds": 0, "def_safeties": 0, "fumble_recovery_own": 0, "fumble_recovery_opp": 3, "fumble_recovery_tds": 0, "penalty_yards": 411, "penalties": 43, "fg_made": 6, "fg_att": 7, "fg_pct": 3.0, "fg_long": 136.0, "pat_made": 13, "pat_att": 13, "pat_pct": 5.0, "punt_returns": 13, "punt_return_yards": 169, "kickoff_returns": 19, "kickoff_return_yards": 486, "special_teams_tds": 0, "total_yards": 1806, "yards_per_game": 361.2, "total_first_downs": 90, "first_downs_per_game": 18.0, "total_turnovers": 5, "turnover_margin": -1, "total_epa": 18.33989852800124, "passing_epa": 16.68590769488338, "rushing_epa": 1.6539908331178594, "receiving_epa": 33.23138392439552}, "NYJ": {"wins": 0, "losses": 5, "ties": 0, "win_pct": 0.0, "conf_record": "0-3", "div_record": "0-2", "road_record": "0-2", "playoff_seed": 16, "clincher": null, "streak_display": "L5", "points_per_game": 22.4, "points_against_per_game": 31.4, "point_diff": -45, "third_down_pct": 34.42622950819672, "third_down_pct_against": 38.333333333333336, "fourth_down_pct": 53.84615384615385, "fourth_down_pct_against": 100.0, "red_zone_pct": 61.53846153846154, "red_zone_pct_against": 60.0, "completion_pct": 67.97385620915033, "yards_per_attempt": 6.5816993464052285, "passer_rating": 0, "passing_yards": 1007, "passing_tds": 7, "interceptions": 1, "sacks_taken": 16, "rushing_yards": 722, "rushing_tds": 4, "yards_per_carry": 5.428571428571429, "receiving_yards": 1007, "receiving_tds": 7, "receiving_first_downs": 53, "targets": 148, "receptions": 104, "receiving_yards_after_catch": 401, "def_sacks": 7.0, "def_tackles_solo": 172, "def_tackles_for_loss": 23, "def_interceptions": 0, "def_fumbles_forced": 5, "def_pass_defended": 19, "def_qb_hits": 14, "def_tds": 0, "def_safeties": 0, "fumble_recovery_own": 2, "fumble_recovery_opp": 0, "fumble_recovery_tds": 0, "penalty_yards": 352, "penalties": 42, "fg_made": 9, "fg_att": 9, "fg_pct": 5.0, "fg_long": 250.0, "pat_made": 7, "pat_att": 7, "pat_pct": 4.0, "punt_returns": 8, "punt_return_yards": 89, "kickoff_returns": 31, "kickoff_return_yards": 854, "special_teams_tds": 1, "total_yards": 1729, "yards_per_game": 345.8, "total_first_downs": 94, "first_downs_per_game": 18.8, "total_turnovers": 6, "turnover_margin": -6, "total_epa": -2.1129467261086488, "passing_epa": 7.556424915224997, "rushing_epa": -9.669371641333646, "receiving_epa": 38.879283162985445}}}
