You are an award-winning NFL analyst and writer, renowned for combining sharp statistical analysis with entertaining, personality-filled writing. You're previewing an upcoming NFL game.

Generate a 2-3 paragraph preview of the upcoming game described in the data below. Include:
1. Key storylines and matchups to watch
2. Recent performance of both teams
3. Key injuries or factors that could impact the game
4. A prediction for how the game might play out (but don't predict a specific score)

Make it engaging and entertaining while maintaining analytical accuracy. Feel free to use some personality and wit in your writing.

IMPORTANT: The game data includes multiple sections:
- **team_records**: AUTHORITATIVE overall season records (wins-losses-ties) for both teams - USE THIS for team records
- **team_season_stats**: Comprehensive season statistics for both teams including efficiency metrics (3rd down %, red zone %), advanced stats (EPA, completion %), records (conference, division, road), and more
- **betting_lines**: Spread, over/under, and money lines
- **espn_predictor**: Win probability predictions (home_win_prob, away_win_prob, matchup_quality)
- **leaders**: Top players in key statistical categories
- **injuries**: Current injury reports
- **gameInfo**: Venue, weather conditions
- **team_profiles/head_coaches/coordinators**: Coaching context and stadium information for each team
- **injury_report**: Extended injury notes with detailed comments and last-updated timestamps
- **recent_news**: Latest team-specific headlines
- **depth_chart_alerts**: Notable starter/lineup status changes from the latest depth chart snapshot
- **recent_form**: Last five game results for each team
- **event_context**: Broadcast, neutral-site, attendance, and special event notes pulled from the scoreboard feed

Use the team_season_stats section for detailed statistical analysis - it has the most comprehensive data.

FORMATTING:
- Use markdown formatting for better readability
- Use **bold** for emphasis on key points, player names, or team names
- Use bullet lists (- or *) when listing multiple matchups or key factors
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines

Consider this a print-ready final draft, so do not include any pre-text like "Here is my preview of the game..." or follow up questions.

THIS IS THE 2025/2026 NFL SEASON

Turnover differential: Packers minus-1; Cardinals plus-1. <hl2>Packers player to watch</hl2> RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4047365/josh-jacobs\">Josh Jacobs</a> has rushed for two touchdowns and gained at least 150 yards from scrimmage in each of Green Bay\u2019s past two games. He rushed for 93 yards on 18 carries and caught five passes for 57 yards against the Bengals despite dealing with an illness. Jacobs said after the game he had vomited on a couple of occasions during the game. <hl2>Cardinals player to watch</hl2> TE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361307/trey-mcbride\">Trey McBride</a> has been one of the few constants in an up-and-down season for the Cardinals' offense. The fourth-year Colorado State product is on the way to another productive season with 37 catches with 347 yards and two touchdowns through six games. <hl2>Key matchup</hl2> The Cardinals have been a run-first team for much of third-year coach Jonathan Gannon's tenure, but the Packers have the NFL's best rushing defense. On top of that, Arizona's top two running backs \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045147/james-conner\">James Conner</a> (foot) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429275/trey-benson\">Trey Benson</a> (knee) \u2014 are out with injuries. <hl2>Key injuries</hl2> Packers: DL <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4686906/lukas-van-ness\">Lukas Van Ness</a> (foot) and DL <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361791/devonte-wyatt\">Devonte Wyatt</a> (knee) won't play on Sunday. WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4248528/christian-watson\">Christian Watson</a> has been practicing on a limited basis as he works his way back from a torn ACL. He also won\u2019t play Sunday. K <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16339/brandon-mcmanus\">Brandon McManus</a> (quadriceps) and RB Josh Jacobs (illness) among seven players listed as questionable. WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362249/jayden-reed\">Jayden Reed</a> (foot/shoulder) is on injured reserve and will miss a fourth straight game. Cardinals: QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917315/kyler-murray\">Kyler Murray</a> (foot), DL <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4569480/darius-robinson\">Darius Robinson</a> (pectoral) and WR <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3059722/zay-jones\">Zay Jones</a> (knee) are among five players who are questionable for Sunday's game. Murray missed his first game of the season last week with the same injury. RB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4362478/emari-demercado\">Emari Demercado</a> (ankle) and DL <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4685503/walter-nolen\">Walter Nolen III</a> are out. <hl2>Series notes</hl2> The two teams have split the past 10 games going back to 2003. The first meeting in the series goes back to 1921, which is the second-oldest rivalry in NFL history. <hl2>Stats and stuff</hl2> The Packers have won their past 11 regular-season games against NFC West teams. \u2026 Packers coach Matt LaFleur (70-34-1) has reached 70 career wins in the shortest amount of time by any coach since Bill Cowher also got his 70th win in his 105th game in 1998, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. \u2026 The Packers are seeking their first road victory. They lost 13-10 at Cleveland and tied Dallas 40-40 in their first two road games. \u2026 The Packers are outscoring teams 24-0 in the first quarter of games. \u2026 The Packers are allowing a league-low 73 yards rushing per game. \u2026 Packers CB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4259493/keisean-nixon\">Keisean Nixon</a> has nine passes defensed to rank second in the NFL, behind Cincinnati\u2019s D.J. Turner (11). \u2026 Packers DE <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4361423/micah-parsons\">Micah Parsons</a> has six quarterback pressures per game according to Next Gen Stats to match Pittsburgh\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4429164/nick-herbig\">Nick Herbig</a> for the highest average in the league. \u2026 <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4245661/lucas-havrisik\">Lucas Havrisik</a> probably would be Green Bay\u2019s kicker on Sunday if McManus remains unavailable. Havrisik filled in for McManus against the Bengals and made both of his field-goal attempts, from 43 and 39 yards. \u2026 The Packers are converting an NFL-leading 52.3% of their third downs. \u2026 The Packers have forced only two takeaways all season. ... This is Arizona's only home game in a span of 40 days from Oct. 6 to Nov. 15. ... All of Arizona's six games this season have been decided by a touchdown or less. The team has lost four straight games by a combined nine points. ... LB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040983/mack-wilson-sr\">Mack Wilson Sr</a>. leads the team with 50 tackles. ... QB <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578570/jacoby-brissett\">Jacoby Brissett</a> started for the injured Murray in last week's game vs. the Colts, completing 27 of 44 passes for 320 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. It was the fifth time in Brissett's career he has thrown for at least 300 yards. ... McBride has at least five catches in eight straight games going back to last season. ... Edge rusher <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3693166/josh-sweat\">Josh Sweat</a> has four sacks in three home games this season. <hl2>Fantasy tip</hl2> Packers rookie wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4701936/matthew-golden\">Matthew Golden</a> hasn\u2019t scored a touchdown yet this season, but he had a career-high 86 yards receiving against the Bengals and has made some big catches in clutch situations in Green Bay\u2019s past two games. Any teams that have been keeping Golden on their benches so far this season might want to insert him into their starting lineups this weekend. ------ AP NFL: <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\">https://apnews.com/hub/nfl</a>", "title": "Cardinals try to snap 4-game losing streak when they host Packers", "video": []}, "format": {"overtime": {"clock": 600.0, "displayName": "sudden-death", "periods": 1, "slug": "sudden-death"}, "regulation": {"clock": 900.0, "displayName": "Quarter", "periods": 4, "slug": "quarter"}}, "gameInfo": {"venue": {"address": {"city": "Glendale", "country": "USA", "state": "AZ", "zipCode": "85305"}, "fullName": "State Farm Stadium", "grass": true, "id": "3970"}, "weather": {"conditionId": "3", "gust": 10, "highTemperature": 85, "lowTemperature": 85, "precipitation": 0, "temperature": 85}}, "injuries": [{"injuries": [{"athlete": {"collegeAthlete": {}, "displayName": "Will Hernandez", "fullName": "Will Hernandez", "id": "3042516", "jersey": "76", "lastName": "Hernandez", "position": {"abbreviation": "G", "displayName": "Guard", "name": "Guard"}, "shortName": "W.
