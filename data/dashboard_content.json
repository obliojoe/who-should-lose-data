The Lions' ground game was dominant, rushing for 164 yards and consistently moving the chains when it mattered most.\n\n## Key Statistics\n\n- **Jahmyr Gibbs**: 17 carries, **136 yards**, 2 touchdowns (including a 78-yard run)\n- **Amon-Ra St. Brown**: 6 receptions, 86 yards, 1 touchdown\n- **Baker Mayfield**: 28/50, 228 yards, 1 touchdown, 1 interception\n- **Total Lions Rushing**: 32 attempts, 164 yards (5.1 yards per carry)\n\nThe victory solidifies the Lions' status as a legitimate NFC contender, while raising questions about the Buccaneers' offensive consistency and defensive resilience. **Dan Campbell's** aggressive coaching style continues to pay dividends, transforming the Lions into a team that no opponent can take lightly.",

Rookie quarterback **Dillon Gabriel** managed the game efficiently, completing 13 of 18 passes for 116 yards, while the ground game, spearheaded by Judkins, controlled the tempo. The Dolphins, who entered as slight favorites, were completely overwhelmed, managing just two field goals and looking utterly hapless against a Browns team that had been struggling mightily coming into the contest.\n\n## Key Statistics\n- **Quinshon Judkins**: 25 carries, 84 yards, 3 touchdowns\n- **Tua Tagovailoa**: 12/23, 100 yards, 3 interceptions, 24.1 passer rating\n- **Browns Turnovers**: 0\n- **Dolphins Turnovers**: 4\n- **Third Down Efficiency**: Browns 4/11, Dolphins 1/13\n\nThe victory not only ends a losing streak for Cleveland but raises serious questions about the Dolphins' consistency and **Mike McDaniel's** long-term future as head coach.
