    "summary": "Week 6 brings chaos to the NFL power structure as **Kansas City** stumbles to 2-3 despite maintaining the #3 power ranking, while **Detroit** and **Philadelphia** emerge as the league's offensive juggernauts. The Lions are *obliterating* defenses at 34.8 points per game with Jared Goff throwing TDs at a historic pace, while the Eagles convert an absurd 92.3% of their red zone opportunities. Meanwhile, **Houston's** suffocating defense (12.2 PPG allowed) and **Cincinnati's** league-leading +11 turnover margin showcase how defense still wins in this offensive explosion era.",
