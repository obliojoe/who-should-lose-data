    "summary": "**DET** continues to light up scoreboards with an offense that looks unstoppable, while **PHI** and **BUF** keep chipping away with balanced attacks and steady defenses. *Momentum matters* this week as surging units like **HOU** tighten up on that side of the ball and suddenly reshape expectations. Upsets and late-game swings have made the standings jittery, and a handful of teams are separating themselves as real contenders. Meanwhile, turnover battles led by **CIN** remain a deciding factor in close games and playoff projections.",
