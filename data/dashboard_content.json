The *perfect storm* brewing in Motor City features Jared Goff completing an absurd 75.3% of his passes while the Lions average nearly 35 points per game. Meanwhile, the league's basement dwellers are setting new standards for futility, with the **Jets** still searching for their first win and multiple 1-4 teams already eyeing draft position.",
