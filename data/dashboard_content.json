The Chiefs' 30-17 win was marked by near-flawless execution and a postgame confrontation that added extra drama to the evening.\n\nMahomes was surgical, throwing for **257 yards and three touchdowns**, while also rushing for another score. **Marquise Brown** was a standout, catching two touchdown passes that helped Kansas City pull away. The Chiefs played a remarkably clean game, committing zero penalties and zero turnovers - a stark contrast to their previous week's performance against Jacksonville.\n\n## Key Statistical Highlights\n\n- **Patrick Mahomes** reached 302 career touchdown passes, becoming the fastest player in NFL history to hit 300 (139 games)\n- **Jared Goff** finished with 203 yards passing, with touchdowns to **Jameson Williams** and **Sam LaPorta**\n- The Chiefs held Detroit's high-powered offense in check, limiting **Jahmyr Gibbs** to just 65 yards on 17 carries\n- **Xavier Worthy** and **Hollywood Brown** each added touchdown receptions\n\nThe game's intensity boiled over at the end, with a postgame scuffle between **Brian Branch** and **JuJu Smith-Schuster** that Lions coach Dan Campbell called \"inexcusable.\"\n\nThe victory moves the Chiefs to 3-3, while the Lions drop to 4-2, ending their recent winning streak in dramatic fashion.",

Despite pedestrian offensive numbers, the Raiders' defense put on a masterclass performance that thoroughly suffocated the Titans' offensive hopes.\n\n**Devin White** was the standout performer, delivering a vintage defensive performance with **nine tackles, a sack, an interception, and a forced fumble** - a stat line that Raiders coach Pete Carroll called extraordinary. The Raiders' pass rush was relentless, sacking rookie quarterback **Cam Ward** six times and consistently disrupting the Titans' offensive rhythm. **Maxx Crosby** and **Jonah Laulu** also made significant defensive contributions, with Crosby recording two sacks and extending his streak of games with a tackle for loss to nine.\n\n## Key Statistics\n\n- **Total Yards**: Raiders 226, Titans 225\n- **Sacks**: Raiders 6, Titans 2\n- **Turnovers**: Raiders 1, Titans 3\n- **Third Down Efficiency**: Raiders 6/13 (46%), Titans 3/13 (23%)\n\nThe victory was particularly sweet for the Raiders, who had been struggling offensively. **Geno Smith** threw for 174 yards and a touchdown, while **Ashton Jeanty** added 75 rushing yards and a score. For the Titans, **Cam Ward** completed 26 of 38 passes for 222 yards, but the constant pressure disrupted his performance.\n\nThis win provides a much-needed boost for the Raiders, who improve to 2-4, while the Titans drop to 1-5 and continue their struggles to find consistency.",
