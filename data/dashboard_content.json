The league's offensive explosion continues with **Detroit** lighting up scoreboards and **Jared Goff** leading an MVP-caliber campaign, while defensive units like **Houston** and **Denver** are proving that elite defense still wins games. Perhaps most shocking is the complete collapse of the AFC North, with **Baltimore** and **Cincinnati** combining for just three wins through five weeks.",
